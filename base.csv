It offers up a very innovative style of gameplay that no one has tried to emulate yet, offers up a presentation that holds up well even today, and slaps on some of the best writing and voice work. This game was amazing when it came out decades ago and valve literally handed us one of the best versions of it on a portable platform. There is nothing here not to love. Now I can easily introduce this game to those who this was before their time. The only negative is I struggle a little with the gamepad, but I cat and mouse for lyfe so that is understandable. There really isn't any puzzles that can't be done on the gamepad without a few tries though.… Expand",10

Both games are over a decade old, and they still are a blast to play even today. I played both games in the past and I still love them.

Don't go in expecting a first-person, guns blazing shooter type of game or one that holds your hand through all the story beats because this game is all about world-building, exploration, and puzzle solving. As you progress, the levels get harder, the story starts to take a more sinister turn, and the uniqueness of it all gets even better. Also, the co-op mode for Portal 2 is its own thing that's easily one of the best co-op experiences out there. About the only downsides to these games are that, if you're at least somewhat decent at puzzles, you can easily blow through them in 2-4 hours (maybe a little more with regard to Portal 2 because it is a more expansive game than the first) and being built off the Source engine means the controls can feel a bit wonky at times, but tbh these are nitpicks in the grand scheme of things. The fact of the matter is, Valve commissioned a port of two their best games for the Switch, updated things where they needed to be updated (resolution, framerate, etc.), and unlike so many new-gen ports, left the rest alone and messed nothing up in the transition. Here's hoping this is but the start for them and that we see future ports of the Half-Life and Left 4 Dead series because there's a reason why so many have such great memories of Valve games.… Expand",10

This was, hands down, some of the best voice acting I've heard in any game currently on the Switch. Portal 2 especially has stellar moments with unforgettable and often hilarious lines delivered by Ellen Mclain, Stephen Merchant, and the legendary J. K.

Never have I been so addicted to a video game that I played it over 30 hours on the first 3 days and I still only scratched the surface.

The sense of progression you get this way is incomparable to other open world games or rpgs. I started out as a naked guy with a stick, went on to be a knight with a bastard sword and shield and now am a powerful scythe wielding sorcerer using the power of dragons and lightning to destroy my enemies. I can understand some people that got drawn in by the BOTW comparisons are having trouble with the combat but it‘s definitely not too hard if you‘re willing to think a little bit about how to approach boss fights.

Elden Ring gives me the same feeling as Skyrim, a feeling of a vast world to explore, with different possibilities, for me, these two games are like brothers, things that only appear from decade to decade in the gaming world. The bosses never disappoint, no matter if it's a dungeon boss, or a main boss, their theme songs are amazing, and you really feel that the moment is a certain tension. The dubbing of the game is to be praised, all the voice actors managed to highlight the presence of their characters well, and this is something that I see little commented on. There are different builds, for all tastes, for all the bosses you want, and this goes back to what I said before, Skyrim and Elden Ring are brothers, both games give you immense possibilities for gameplay, magic, archery, one hand, two hands, punch.

This game has one of the best worlds to explore I've ever seen in any game I have played; the visuals are spectacular and not one single inch feels wasted. One of my favorite things about this game is every weapon and spell looks cool but also feel viable to the point you can pretty much make any build you want. This game is the peak of From Software's design in Dark Souls in giving freedom to the players to play however they want. The fluid combat and the added ability to jump add to the great experience of fighting and exploring in this game. The games story like other soul's games is very obscure but also very rich if you are willing to look for it. The characters are mostly good, but I felt they could have done more with certain ones. Most main game bosses feel and look very cool and are fun to fight. Some people don't like the reuse of enemies throughout the game but overall, I think they did a good job of making them unique to the areas you fight them and the powers they use, making them feel like new enemies. Difficulty wise Elden Ring is probably the easiest soul's game with the only exception being Malenia. With 85 deaths in Elden Ring total, 46 of which were due to Malenia leaving 39 from the rest of the game compared to, 38 deaths in Dark Souls 1 and 55 deaths in Dark Souls 3 it just felt extremely easy. One problem I had was Malenia and her being able to use her waterfowl dance 5 times in the span of a minute, if I could change one thing, I would give that move a 60 second cool down after she uses it. Overall, Elden Ring has slight issues with difficulty balancing but they are so small that it doesn't change how amazing this game is. I'll be playing Dark Souls 2 next… Expand",10

I think dark souls 2 only had 40 or so? I wish I could appreciate this game more and I respect the effort put into it. But somehow. Its too much for me personally. Which is weird. Maybe they should change the multiplayer mechanics so that you can interact with players in real time with no summon signs. Instead of summons it could end up being alot more organic. I'm sure covenants could still be implemented in some form or fashion. I just think if you're going to have such a large open world. You may as well make it more social.

I'm a FromSoft veteran who's completed the King's Field and Dark Souls series, Bloodborne and Sekiro multiple times. This game isn't difficult like Sekiro or Bloodborne difficult. Those bosses were challenging, but very do-able. The problem I have, is that the majority of bosses in Elden Ring just spam attacks absolutely non-stop with infinite FP and stamina, leaving an absolute minuscule window to get hits in. Soloing this game is nigh-on impossible, especially late game when the difficulty is rammed even higher and suddenly. These games, which heavily punish the player for mindless aggression, Miyazaki is quite happy to not apply that rule to his AI. And it proves how BS a boss is when noone even drops down co-op summon signs, because they don't want to go through that certain boss again. I'm not saying it needs to be made easier, just a little evenly balanced. But then maybe try and embrace a wider audience by adding a slightly easier mode? All you need to do really is keep runes on death, that's it.

Elden Ring is a soulslike in an open world. And while this is its biggest strength it seems to turn out as its achilles heel as well. 90% of users rating low argue like they expected the next epic, narration driven mainstream role-play-opera with accessible gameplay, an average or at least scalable difficulty and a somewhat cinematic approach to quests and storytelling. So maybe the real problem with Elden Ring is the extreme hype, making more casual gamers buy it for all the wrong reasons and certainly with the wrong expectations. And this is what lead to disappointment and absurdly emotional and negative reviews. However from an objective point of view a nine or ten is a thousand times more justified than any kind of review bombing.

Or if you like well executed game mechanics, masterful artwork and: stunning visuals that are not outdated at all.  If you're not, simply let it be.

Elden Ring is yet another entry to the Souls genre, and this time steps away from the tried and true design of tightly crafted game worlds that Fromsoft usually brings us. Unfortunately, we are left with a bland and lifeless Overworld, connected with obscured dungeons that feel copied straight from Bloodborne's Chalice Dungeons. There was something missed in translation here, as most open worlds draw you in with a plethora of things to experience, not just empty space between the next thing to kill.Speaking of killing, the entire game revolves around removing enemies out of your way. This is the same as every Souls game, but this is supposed to be an open world experience. Imagine just laying a linear game out on top of a big map and calling it ""open world"" now. With nothing else to do, you will be traveling across large, empty expanses to find another repetitive dungeon, another rehashed enemy, another reskinned boss...with rewards that do not give you incentive to explore. You hit walls where you cannot pass, so you must go try a different route until you are strong enough to do the ""intended"" route. You will begin to lose steam after the honeymoon phase wears off. The bosses get progressively more ridiculous as you move through the game. Instead of opting for a dance of combat like Bloodborne or Sekiro, you will spend the entire battle rolling around, counting on iframes to help scrape you out of a 9-hit combo alive, where each hit of the combo can chunk you for most of your health. Enemies everywhere rely on delay attacks, holding their weapons in the air just until you finish rolling for a cheap kill. Some will defy physics and spin midair to land on you. The whole thing is about being cheesed by enemies or cheesing them by leveling. Even having the strongest physical defense armor in the entire game, plus dumping most of your points into Vigor, you will still be 2 shot by end bosses. Highly disappointing. The ""open world"" is rife with shambling creatures that walk in circles or wait patiently for you to approach and dispatch them.  NPC stand around, lifeless in this uninspired world. You cannot track any quests, so unless you have a really good memory, you are expected to play with a journal by your side for notes. The UI used is ugly and over a decade old. Movement is nearly a direct copy from Dark Souls 3, with weapon Arts. The biggest crime here, though, is the reviews from Critics. Unanimously overflowing 10/10 review from nearly every gaming company out there. For a continuation of pretty niche type of game, the how is unreal. Especially when NOTHING here is revolutionary, inventive, or deserving of the word ""masterpiece."" At best it is bait to get people to buy Elden Ring, only to be highly disappointed after the refund return window has closed. Lastly, the hype of George RR Martin to sell the game! This is just using a name to sell your product. You can replace entire words with phrases from Dark Souls. Point of Lost Grace = Bonfire. Watch reviews (not 10/10 ""critic"" reviews, but actual USER reviews), check out some gameplay. Read reddit posts that are not biased towards it being great.

Story is told in very lazy way but no one cares about that. Enemy design (especially bosses of course) is often brilliant and the music is fantastic. The open world is fun to explore but to stay it's revolutionary is far from the truth imo. The only things that makes this game so exciting is chemistry in your brain. The thrill of defeating a giant boss is amazing, and the hard, fixed difficulty is what makes every encounter so intense. Same for exploration and the sense of constant danger. It's no wonder that From Software refused to add an easy mode. Without the sense of accomplishment after beating a boss, without the constant fear and sense of danger, this game has almost nothing to offer, and it's definitely not a next-gen, must play title.… Expand",5

You can only feel safe when you're resting at a bonfire. When you play for the first time, you never know what to expect. Enemies are strategically placed, as well as traps. And they're everywhere, all the time. Elden Ring can't do this. There are long pauses to ""commune with nature"", because the big empty open world is not threatening. You can see the enemies from distance, and you're never caught by surprise. The way from Ruin A to Ruin B is safe and sound... And once you approach Ruin B, you know ""ok, now I'll face some challenge"", at this moment, there's no tension, it was ruined by the anticipation. You always know what to expect and when;8.

In my opinion it seems the over the top and unbalanced difficulty is put in place to mask the clunky fighting mechanics and big flaws in the game.  Dark souls cultists will love this game and claim everyone who doesn't needs to GG and that they just don't like difficult games, but gamers who are used to other games whether they are very difficult or on the easier side, technical fighting games, and polished open world games will see this game as not designed for them hence the misleading marketing push for this game to try and sell it.  It would be one thing if I had fun playing this but I didn't.  I feel like I wasted my money on an expensive game.  I don't recommend getting this.The fighting mechanics are the biggest disappointment for me because it's not really different.  When comparing the fighting mechanics to say Nioh 2, it was just boring.  Nioh 2 had waay more moves and a waay deeper fight system to perfect in a souls style kind of game.  Why didn't From Software learn from that?  The fighting mechanics alone should make this game not worthy of perfect reviews in light of Nioh 2 even from the cultists. And the reviews and marketing push on this game have really been misleading.  I suspect because they know most people will not enjoy playing this game's highly clunky fighting mechanics, unnecessary and unbalanced difficulty, and being left to deal with no tutorial except the From Software cultists.  Do you want a game that you have to look up how to find or get past anything every step of the way on YouTube? Most people would say I don't might doing that here and there but if the game is reliant on that because of how it was designed or poorly designed then no.  And anyone claiming this is like Breath of the Wild is an idiot.  Horizon Forbidden West is an easier game but it is a better designed game overall and should be easily beating this game rating wise.

It is not a meaningful representation of any world setting. Best way to explain what it is a Lovecraftian nightmarish realm with bosses and monsters spread around the map. Only meaningful anchors for a human players are the occasional NPCs that are as vendors. They are incredibly out of place, literally and figuratively. So this cannot be the best Open World RPG game ever, since it is neither a open world nor an RPG game. It is a soul game takes place on a open area/field. It is more like a monster fighting arena game with skill progression. It is not something you can compare to Witcher3 or Skyrim etc. Let's get that part straight first since professional media is misleading players who are not familiar with Soul games. Defining characteristic of a Soul game is ""extremely hard"" boss fights. And not its story. Not so surprisingly that is also the case here. There is no meaningful story here, there are tons of obscure and non sensical narrative. Part Japanese translation, part source material. Whatever GRR martin has written (if any), clearly developer just tromped on it and what is left is nonsensical garbage.  You will enjoy this game, if primary reason you play the games is challenge and skill progression. The game is closer to MMOs than single player open world RPGs. You need to farm a lot in this game to give your character a chance to kill next required boss. It has even same MMO raid zoning type setups in the game. Now i know i sound negative. But in reality game is an addictive and good game. It is more like 7 or 8 out of 10. That is if you like the unique genre this game is. Yes there is something like that. It is called ""Soul like"" games. You die hundreds of times and build the skillset to kill impossibly difficult nightmarish next boss. Graphics of the game is closer to Oblivion than Skyrim, much worse than Witcher3, or Red Dead Redemption. It runs on old engine. Developer tried to compensate this by adding ""Silmarillion"" style majestic light trees, and that is creating an illusion of fantastic setting. graphics are poor. But artistic style is good, with what is available to them developers created an interesting world. I wish they actually put some stories in there to explain the lore behind it. Overall it is the best Souls game. but it is no way the best open world RPG where all reviewers are lying about. Be aware before buying. Especially the ones that are not familiar with this genre. So how did this game got the 10/10 scores from all professional reviewers. It looks like there is a simple answer. Because unlike other games, only the ""soul fanatics"" reviewed this game. Why is that? Because game is so so difficult to play and beat in the given time frame for a preview of 1 week, for most media sites, only the Fans of the Soul like games have committed to the review, and result is magnum opus rating, for a not so magnum opus product. Now that said, i started to enjoy more and more as i play the game. It is extremely addictive and exploration and character progression aspects are well done. So i am altering my score to 6. I think if you are not uber fan of souls genre, this is more reasonable rating. Ultimately IMO Elden ring is not an RPG game, it is an Arcade game with similarities to modern MMOs than popular open world RPGs. Its biggest flaw in my mind it does not have a cohesive story, you can finish this entire game and you wouldnt know what the heck it was about. Every human you encounter in this world, save few NPCs are hostile against you. By definition the world is not immersive, it is an arcade battleground with focus on combat and killing bosses. Peace out.… Expand",6

This game goesTagline : ""Most overrated Runescape clone, hyped up by people who hate the fact that GTA and Assassin's Creed are popular"" What specs you need to run it 60fps - 1080p or 4K, without stutter or lag?- Honest answer is that, no matter how good your PC is, no matter, if you have PS5, this game will perform horribly and only thing you can do is wait for multiple patches. This game goes into same category of games, that have been extremely overhyped and extremely underdelivered. Other examples would be ""Cyberpunk 2077"", ""Fallout 76"", ""Anthem"", ""Battlefield 2042"" and ""Elden Ring"" is another fine addition to that list. So what new groundbreaking mechanics, graphics, open world design, innovative combat or interesting story this game offers? - Pretty much none of these. Graphically (for some weird reason) this game goes back to 2012/2013. But 2012/2013 had lots of great games and at times ""Elden Ring"" even looks beautiful, especially the sky, but ground and grass textures are pretty much worse than some 2013 games. For 2022 AAA release this is bad. Game that gets Metascores 95/97 in 2022, should have way more work put into it. Next up is open world design - There's extreme amount of boring looking, absolutely empty areas. This is automatically bad open world design, because these empty areas, that doesn't even look good have zero purpose to be there. Other areas that actually have something, okay let's make that clear, all that other areas have is trees and monsters. Endless amount of monsters that are simply sitting there, doing nothing, waiting for you to slay them. This is literally Runescape game design 101, i have been playing Runescape since 2004, i know what i'm talking about. Quests (if you can even call them) are extremely short, boring and you can literally ignore all of them. It's usually some lady asking you to go somewhere, get something, get it back to her. Most hilarious thing is that game doesn't show that you have completed any of them, which basically means that by the end of the game, you forget that you even did these. Runescape has more complex lore, quests and writing than this game can only dream of. Why i'm talking about Runescape and not Skyrim, you might ask - Well because lore wise, Skyrim would be too tough challenger for this game. Combat is extremely similar to Dark Souls 3, game that released 6 years ago. Same animations, same everything. Anyone who says in that case that ""Innovation is overrated"" has no right to criticize Rockstar or Ubisoft ever again, just saying. Anyone who says that having horse is innovative must be a troll, because having this empty open world without any transportation, would be almost insulting. All in all very weak release, only fun i had in this whole game were two boss fights - Margit and Godrick, i have to say they have extremely unfair combos, attacks and they are pointlessly difficult to beat, especially for 2 first bosses, but at least they have some interesting lore and cool monster design. 1 point for beautiful sky design, 1 point for Margit boss design and 1 point for Godrick boss design. Overall score 3/10 - Not recommending, unless you have never played open world game before, but even then, you just could play older open world games that are way better.… Expand",3

So i have zero issues with 2015 graphics, i love 2015 graphics, but not on 2022 games, that should have 2022 graphics. Is this too complicated to understand for fanboys? But even then, i could play it with these graphics, if actual game itself was good. Sadly it's far, far from good. It's extremely mediocre, world is E M P T Y. There's nothing but empty areas between caves and monster locations and then you find some small ruins here or there. That's the whole map design. That's bad. That's amateur level or map designing. Story is there, but it's not nearly fun or interesting enough, that i would spend hours learning every boss move sets. I actually liked how bosses looked like (like their look, not how they make combos or whatever, but just how they look like). I think dragons looked way too basic, but some MAIN bosses, looked interesting enough. I almost got this anime vibe, that very first boss already feels like final boss, but actually there's countless of other bosses after him, who are ever stronger, bigger, etc. Sadly that wasn't enough for me, i wanted this game to be way more complex than just boss killing simulator, i wanted it to be deeper, i wanted it to be actually INTERESTING. I can tolerated difficult bosses, if game itself is interesting enough for me, to want to keep going. But this game doesn't have that. It doesn't have that ""Resident Evil 4"" (2005) vibe where there will be cool story moments after this epic boss fight, etc. There's none of that. If you beat the two bosses in castle, all you get is just another big swamp area full of random generic monsters for you to fight with.

214,"DONT BUY. Melee dex is completely freaking useless I had to farm endlessly as a dex melee character to beat the second boss, I farmed til I was level 50 while he is like a level 20. Meanwhile mages are one shotting bosses. This game is just beyond awful. If you play a melee character you will die endlessly, as every boss and miniboss and strong normal mobs have aoe attack with tracing! OhDONT BUY. Melee dex is completely freaking useless I had to farm endlessly as a dex melee character to beat the second boss, I farmed til I was level 50 while he is like a level 20. Meanwhile mages are one shotting bosses. This game is just beyond awful. If you play a melee character you will die endlessly, as every boss and miniboss and strong normal mobs have aoe attack with tracing! Oh and also 80%+ are faster than you. Not to mention theres both input delay and input que take when you dodge roll for instance so the roll happens 0.5 sec later (great design in a reflex game, real genius) and regarding input delay you will die many a time due to your character deciding to do a command 2 commands ago. Also this games design is just awful, damn awful. Lets compare this awful game to some of my favorite games like take dota 2, (the real hardest game in the world not filled with BS mechanics) and diablo 2. In dota 2 all heroes are free and everyone is at equal footing since everyone can pick everyone. This means that even though you might die to another hero you can just spam that hero from now on and realise his strengths and weaknesses after 10-100 games. In diablo 2 theres this frustrating mechanic called hit recovery. What it does is it stunlocks you if damage taken exceeds 12% of max life. Now it can be very annoying getting stun locked to death, but this leads me to my point: in diablo 2 the enemys ALSO HAS HIT RECOVERY. IN OTHER WORDS ITS AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD. I CAN STUNLOCK THEM TO DEATH ALSO LEADING ME TO NOT GET MAD IF I GET STUN LOCKED TO DEATH COMPLETELY UNLIKE ELDEN RING, WHERE BOSSES HAVE ENDLESS STAMINA (unlike the melee characters who can only do 4 hits, or atleast samurai can only do that the character im playing..). Enemys also often 2 or 3 shot me while I have put the last 30 levels into damage through dexterity and gotten ONE damage point per level. ONE. This game isnt even hard like the fanboys claim (and then just insult you and tell you to get good when you call out bosses tracing you mid attack during a dodge roll) its just watching, waiting to get a single or two hits in if youre melee then trying to bait out the correct range to do it again. The bosses have much more fun than the player characters they actually have cool combos and skillsets and get to play the game, the player character just stands and runs around waiting for the bosses endless combos to end. Buy this game if you love dying unfairly hundreds of times, cheesy out dated artificial difficulty mechanics, **** controls due to it being a console port, and running around aimlessly in an empty world.… Expand",0

For anyone who want Dark Souls in an open world, this game is for you. However this will not appeal to a large number of people. This is touted as being ""the most accessible Souls game ever"" which may in fact be the case. If it is, it still has a long way to go. The lack of markers on the map is supposed to ""give you more incentive to explore the world"" when in fact it just makes everything tedious. The lack of a quest log means that you have to manually keep track of any side quests, which is absolutely absurd that a game in 2022 doesn't have a quest log. I honestly can't even think of how that can be construed as a positive. In terms of graphics, it looks like a late PS3/early PS4 game and it has FPS issues even on PS5. The UI looks like something out of the early 2000s. As for the story, most of the side quests actually have a better story than the main story, which is kinda sad. You're likely either going to need a second playthrough or some googling to fully grasp the story, which is pretty bad game design. Don't take lessons from Kingdom Hearts when it comes to story. To summarize, if you like Dark Souls, you'll probably like this game. If you don't want to feel like the game you're playing is a chore, steer clear from this game.… Expand",2

It’s a stellar game that perfectly captures both, the scale and bombast of the older entries in the series, and the heart and grounded nature of God of War (2018). From beginning to end, it’s an exciting romp that delivers a steady stream of thrills, whether you’re going through its captivating story, engaging with its massively improved combat, or getting lost in the endlessly explorable and wonderfully designed Nine Realms of Norse mythology. It might seen like an iterative upgrade on paper, but it’s much more than that- not for the first time, a new God of War game has come along and set a new standard for the medium at large.

Example you have a special skill that lets you shoot a fireball, you have a puzzle that requires you to light up a candle from a distance. My first thought was ok i have this new fire ball skill maybe i can just shoot the fire ball to light it up, nope doesnt even effect the candle even with a direct hit, instead  you need to use the magic arrows to light a path around wall and you have to perform a specific chain bomb skill to complete the puzzle. This type of gameplay is so outdated and frustrating. The story is unsatisfying. The start of it is great but it gets worse the more you play, with all the forced female empowerment moments, all the cringy new characters that you don't care about getting so much screen time and development. Kratos gets completely neutered in this story, its not enough that he doesn't want to fight anymore but now he takes order from the worst character in this series (Freya) with her stupid motivations. Odin and Thor were great but we didn't get enough from them, Odin's motivations were fantastic and i actually was rooting for him to succeed because i wanted to know the answers to his questions but no we get a ton a build up and they seemingly drop the most interesting part of the story. Kratos and Atreus carry the game with their performances but that can only get you so far, by the end i didn't care anymore because everything else was just so frustrating. Dear Sony, lets retire the Uncharted/Naughty Dog formula.

There isn't much there in terms of gameplay evolution, this could be fine if the story was better however it is not as well written as the previous. I personally believe this is due to the dumbing down of the overall design. The puzzles in the gameplay frankly are a zero out of ten. Not because of the puzzles themself most are easy enough but due to the NPCS literally being on a 25 second timer to flat out tell you exactly how to do the puzzle. The designers don't even give you a single minute to try and figure it out before whatever NPC you are with explaining what to do and then rushing you along once you finish the puzzle. It is incredibly infuriating and is very telling of who this game was designed for. To put it simply the target audience of this game, is not serious gamers. It is people who do not like video games, or people who really just wanted to watch a movie. The NPCS rush you along through puzzles, long stretched out moments of just walking and dialogue, basic gameplay with no major evolutions. The highest difficulty feels like what the normal difficulty would be on a game made 12 years ago. This game is designed for the lowest common denominator and frankly it's insulting to be treated like an idiot by the game itself, but that is one of the dead giveaways to who it is designed for. The Sony formula is getting stale and the people who find this design appealing are dwindling. It has become an echo chamber of Sony fan boys while genuine criticism gets swished away as petty hate.

Ragnarok is EXACTLY the sum of its parts, lacking the charm and writing polish that set the previous entry apart. The gameplay has not been expanded in any meaningful way and, in some regards, has regressed back to more ""video-gamey"" systems. ARagnarok is a wholly disappointing sequel to the triumph that was God of War 2018, a game that was, to me, greater than the sum of its parts. Ragnarok is EXACTLY the sum of its parts, lacking the charm and writing polish that set the previous entry apart. The gameplay has not been expanded in any meaningful way and, in some regards, has regressed back to more ""video-gamey"" systems. A visual feast, this game is; a meaningful, complete experience it is not. It suffers under the weight of its uninteresting narrative, resulting in a clunky, slow, meandering game with a dull payoff. The phrase ""it feels like a Marvel movie"" has been thrown around by some detractors, and perhaps rightfully so; this game is so Disney-fied that it barely feels like a God of War game, even less one made by the same studio as 2018's entry. Cory Barlog said something along the lines of 'I don't want my team nor myself to be working on another GoW game for the next 15 years,' and I don't think that's an unreasonable idea. The problem is that so much stuff got scrapped in order to keep this game within the ideal AAA length, and it shows. Plot points, characters, and artifacts lead to nowhere. There's always someone or something new to talk to or find, but rarely are the reasons why expanded upon. At the end of all this is a game full of ideas that are never resolved. The mid-game feels like filler, its connection to the main plot unclear and its consequences even less clear. Most of the game is spent cleaning up other people's messes as Kratos randomly decides to become the World's Best Dad and neighbor to all. This makes him a reactive protagonist and makes the game boring in turn, as most of your time is now spent waiting for something bad to happen so Kratos can step in and fix it. Ragnarok showed its hand too early and, oh boy, was it a weak one. The gimmick fight against Thor failed to recapture the magic that was the Baldur fight from 2018. Cut back to the cabin and here's Odin, the All-Father, the king of Asgard, talking like he's in an episode of Seinfeld. His goal is to stop Ragnarok, something he's desperately trying to figure out (supposedly), yet every appearance shows him frolicking around as if there's nothing wrong. This seems to be a common theme, actually, as every character seems to feel no sense of urgency. There wouldn't even be a game here if Kratos wasn't so prideful in the first hour; him and Odin have the same goal and, by the end of the game, Kratos has evolved into someone who actively wants peace, so... why even deny Odin's truce in the first place? The story stumbles through the realms, eventually limping to a dull, unsatisfying conclusion. The discrepancies throughout this game's story make my head hurt, but these aren't just limited to the narrative. The gameplay and level design have taken massive hits, especially the latter; the sprawling landscapes dotted with colossal set pieces found in the first game have been scrapped in favor of narrow hallways and one-way streets littered with ""puzzles."" These ""puzzles"" are never difficult but are so great in number that they quickly became tedious. I never thought I would be complaining about roadblocks in video games but man, I miss the dynamic puzzles from the first game. At least they were a little more complex. The skill trees are unnecessary for two reasons: one is that you get so much XP so quickly that you never need to worry about unlocking skills; the second is that these skills are so ineffective that you're better off without them. The skills in the first game had real responses in-game, like the stance-changing R1 attack doing more posture damage, rewarding the risk you had to take just to activate it. In this game, enemies can walk off a stagger as long as there's another animation in their attack cycle. The parry windows are never consistent and, even if you do pull off a perfect parry, there's no guarantee that the riposte will hit- and that's EVEN IF the enemy gets staggered at all. There's no dueling or back-and-forth combat, just passive waiting until you can punish a lucky stagger or shield bash. God of War: Ragnarok feels like a visual novel. My button inputs mean very little because the story is more important. But... the story is boring. I'm not invested in something where all the cool stuff happens in cutscenes where control has been taken away from me. The major boss battles ARE cutscenes; they take no skill to beat, instead you just whittle away their health bar until you get to the next cutscene where Kratos does something cooler than you could ever hope to achieve in real combat. This game was so badly mishandled that I'm not even excited for the next game by SSM. I don't think Ragnarok is a bad game, but it's a bad God of War game. Unfortunately, we may never know just how good this game could have been. In appealing to the lowest common denominator, this game became bland and soulless. What a shame.… Expand",6

P5 is one of those rare JRPGs where it's content to let you learn the story and mechanics at a decent pace, and I challenge you not to find yourself liking at least two or three of the side characters. The music is excellent, the writing is pretty good, the art (specifically the animations and the transitions from 2D to 3D and vice versa) is outstanding, and overall this is a monumentally popular game for an extremely good reason.… Expand",9

The gameplay loop of going around palaces and fighting shadows is fun and doesn't get too repetitive through out the game as new challenges or abilities change up the gameplay. Small note: the games difficulty level is surprising good (If you aren't power leveling). I played it on medium and it actually had good challenge.My favorite part of the game has got to be the music and art direction. It's definitely the best in any game I've played so far. 10/10 Whilst it may be minor all the little menus and the animations in the persona powers all felt fitting and unique, and definitely  enhanced my play experience.Last note: Played this on the xbox series s, had 0 crashes or major bugs, ran without issue.Overall it's about an 8.5-9, not perfect but great.Highly recommend… Expand",9

I was unsure about the series if it was for me so I always went back and forth if I wanted to spend the money on it. By the end of my play though it held the title as one of the best games I have ever played. I have been holding off on playing through P5 Royal on the hopes that it would come to the Switch. Finally after waiting (way less than others who have been long fans) I have loved getting to re-experience this game and experience the Royal additions on Switch. Definitely one of the strongest (if not the strongest) ports to come to the switch. The game runs excellent on the aging console. Returning to the soundtrack, art style, and tone of the Persona 5 world has truly been a delight. Running on the oled Switch is the best handheld experience with all the vibrant colors and style of Persona 5. I cannot imagine a better way to replay this or to play it for the first time. My only critique is the slight hazy effect that is there when playing in handheld. You do quickly get used to it and the game runs very clear when docked so it is not the end of the world and not even enough for me to subtract a point due to it being more on Nintendo than Atlus. Could not be happier jumping into this game again. I know some are frustrated that it is priced at the full price. Personally I don't mind paying the full amount considering my first play through was from the playstation collection. So I am more than happy to pay for the game to be on Switch. If nothing else it is a fantastic port that I think is worth the cost to show that people want Atlus games and the Persona series to have a permanent home on Switch.… Expand",10

The art direction is stellar but the turn-based combat hasn't added anything new to the formula, the story is written superficially, and none of these characters have depth that feels genuine. Attempting to get through it again with the port and see if I just didn't give it a fair chance, these thoughts are repeating.So the answer is nothing. It's not. Persona 5 hides how painfully average it is through flashy aesthetics and pretty art. Leaving out how inaccessible it is if you're not playing in a brightly lit room and get migraines from the saturated red that flashes every two minutes, it's a fantastic game to look at. It's visually pleasing right down to the fonts it chooses. This is the only aspect of the game that shines. The story is at it's absolute high at the very beginning, it smacks you over the head with how power structures enable abusers to stay at the top. Which is fantastic but as the game progresses it constantly contradicts itself, reflecting how either the writers did not properly communicate or fully understand what they were commenting on in the first place. Any criticism of the story in Persona games is often twisted by the fanbase as they herald it to be the pinnacle of video game literature, accusing others of lacking media literacy while they themselves are a modern Tolstoy. This is why I gave it another chance... To see if they actually had a point. As for the gameplay, while pretty, the dungeons require zero thought to get through. As long as you explore every room, you're bound to beat the ""puzzles."" Combat is vanilla SMT with watered down demon negotiations. The game is artificially lengthened by bloating it with repetitive dialog, drawn out subplots, surface level social simulation, and unnecessary mechanics that simulate how it feels to watch grass grow in real time.The Switch port runs fantastic though. They did a great job optimizing it. Persona 5 Royal is a game that succeeded in marketing something that seemed like it was more than it ultimately was.

And the Switch has some of the lower quality in terms of graphics, models, and the like, but that's just a surface-level critique in my opinion others might expect more if they pay for something at that price and it looks rather poor, this doesn't really lessen the experience as much for most people due to the game just being overall fun for everyone, it's a great game and easily deserves some time if you're willing to give it that.… Expand",10

There seems to be very little to this game that's wholly unique; almost everything you see has been ripped shamelessly from Dark Souls 3 or Bloodborne and changed slightly (if even that).- No benefit to the addition of an open world. It serves no purpose to enrich the gameplay and in fact hurts the game as FromSoftware has had great level design in past games which can't be accomplished as well with an open world game. Furthermore, the world feels extremely empty and dead as there are ridiculously vast amounts of lands filled with nothing.- Crafting adds unnecessary bloat to a game that doesn't really need it and mounted combat trivializes the vast majority of fights, which is probably because the overworked developers didn't have time to design any of the fights against it. In conclusion, Elden Ring proves that FromSoftware is no longer the innovative game developer from a few years ago that was afraid to take risks and give us something fresh and new. Elden Ring is an exact, formulaic repeat of every Souls game that came after Dark Souls 2 that feels mediocre at best. This isn't Elden Ring, this is Souls 2K22.… Expand",5

Who knows...You can't rebind many controls, so you're stuck with a poor layout. You can add markers on the map but there are less than 10 icons and you can't add text, a very poor and lazy system.When you mouse over a location the tooltip doesn't pop out, you have to move a target icon with WASD over the location. When buying items you can't compare stats with what you're using...I have no words for this...it's just pathetic for a 2022 AAA 80 euro game...pathetic.While you can accept quests from the very few NPCs you find around, there is no quest log to remind you of anything you're supposed to do.In order to quit you have to open a menu, select an option, switch to the right window, select quit, return to the title screen, watch the titles, press any key, scroll the menu, select quit again...tedious. Controls are crap, some of them you can change others not and the default layout makes you think that whoever made it has never played a PC game before.To use quick items you have to hold E and press the Arrows letting the mouse go...instead of simply pushing comfortable buttons like 1-5 or QERFTGZXCV.Sprint and dodge are on the same button instead of Shift and At, this will lead to often dodgeroll instead of sprinting or you having to release the sprint and push it again in order to dodgeroll.You have to manually select Mouse&Keyboard prompts inside the Audio Menu (why!?), otherwise the game shows you XBox Controller shortcuts, even though you don't have a controller.It records commands while you're character is stuck in an animation and when the animations ends it fires them one after another...Can't climb which has become a standard in many Open World games.The trailers let you believe you get a flying horse of some sort, but the reality is that there are only a bunch of jumping pads positioned here and there. Camera is terrible and when you turn it, it keeps trembling and stuttering cause the script is fighting your command trying to constantly reposition the camera and giving you headache; sometimes it goes completely crazy and keeps turning in circles for no reason. AI sometimes is good others poor, for instance enemies can see you trough walls and attack you without checking the line of sight, e.g. archers keep firing at you even though you're are behind a wall. Combat doesn't have fixed rules, they keep changing so they can kill you easily.Some enemies get staggered when you hit them or block their attacks, others don't, and keep hitting you like nothing happened.Sometimes you can avoid a frontal attack by dodging towards the side or the back of an enemy, others the enemy while already in an attack animation, suddenly performs a 360° turn and hits you anyway.Projectiles like arrows, bolts, ballista shots, etc are guided missiles that turns midair following and hitting you even if you've moved sideways or dodged them.If while attacking your weapon hits a wall you get staggered, but when and enemy does it nothing happens, theirs animation isn't interrupted like yours.Spells are completely unbalanced and 95% of them are useless cause they deal much less damage then the basic one, making you think they didn't even test this game properly.They said you could play as an archer, but you simply can't cause you have to craft arrows and in order to do that you have to grind materials wasting more arrows, notto mention that sometimes you're going to die for hours while fighting a boss, which means you're going to waste thousand of arrows.A simple solution would have been letting you craft quivers with infinite arrows and enchant them to cast fire/poison/magic arrows, etc. Too complicated for these devs I guess. As I said, it's a horrible, poor, lazy and inexcusable port.… Expand",6

The game looks at least 5 years dated if not 10 years. Poor animations as if I'm playing ""Risen""Not a terrible game, but has a lot of issues. The PC port is one of the worst of all time. There is no proper keyboard and mouse support, there are random locked keybindings for menu navigation. All the prompts are using controller buttons. A lot of people report stuttering and crashes. The game looks at least 5 years dated if not 10 years. Poor animations as if I'm playing ""Risen"" or something. And the performance is similarly not in line with its looks. Comparing it to the recent Sony ports for example is like night and day. Games like HZD or God of War really showcases how little effort Elden Ring devs put in towards making the game look good and run well on PC. The open world aspect of the game suffers from issues that plague most open world games. There's a lot to explore and a lot of stuff to find but most of it is meaningless filler. 90% of the loot you find does not feel rewarding for the time and effort you invest into finding it. The story and narrative is a mess. It's as if someone wrote a book and then put all the pages through a randomizer. There's some kind of a story, but it's basically intentionally vague and confusing so that you wouldn't even bother trying to understand it and would simply go and fight monsters. And as for the fighting - enemy AI is dumber than dirt, as if often the case with fantasy games. When it comes to creating non-human enemies, developers default to ""they see you and they will chase you"" coding. That's all there is. No tactics, no nothing. Bosses are fun to fight, but at the end of the day, they all boil down to the exact same thing. You learn their limited move set and then you can beat them to death with a club while being butt naked and not even taking a single point of damage. There are no crazy tactics and cool strategies to beat bosses. You can pretty much run through the whole game naked and weaponless if you could memorize every boss mechanic. Personally, I find that it takes out a lot of incentive to explore and try to improve your character, because even with good gear, a lot of the bosses still have moves that decimate you. So no matter what, you still kinda have to learn how to beat them. So more gear and xp just makes enemies faster to kill. Which is different from a lot of other games where you kinda have to level and gear up because the enemies are literally not possible to beat otherwise. The developers also clearly ran out of ideas a quarter of the way through the game. As whole areas and boss fights end up being copy-pasted and refurbished. The scenery might change a little, the enemies might be differently coloured, but they're same as before. This again isn't new to most open world games, but it does add more evidence to why Elden Ring doesn't really do much anything that's ""next gen"" or creative. All in all, I would recommend most people to check out the game, if only to be aware of what's one of the most hyped up games of all time. But get ready to refund the game, because odds are, you will not be particularly impressed by it. If the game even runs on your PC at all. I got my copy refunded on Steam without issue, so do make use of their generous refund policy to demo out the game.… Expand",6

This game goesTagline : ""Most overrated Runescape clone, hyped up by people who hate the fact that GTA and Assassin's Creed are popular"" What specs you need to run it 60fps - 1080p or 4K, without stutter or lag?- Honest answer is that, no matter how good your PC is, no matter, if you have PS5, this game will perform horribly and only thing you can do is wait for multiple patches. This game goes into same category of games, that have been extremely overhyped and extremely underdelivered. Other examples would be ""Cyberpunk 2077"", ""Fallout 76"", ""Anthem"", ""Battlefield 2042"" and ""Elden Ring"" is another fine addition to that list. So what new groundbreaking mechanics, graphics, open world design, innovative combat or interesting story this game offers? - Pretty much none of these. Graphically (for some weird reason) this game goes back to 2012/2013. But 2012/2013 had lots of great games and at times ""Elden Ring"" even looks beautiful, especially the sky, but ground and grass textures are pretty much worse than some 2013 games. For 2022 AAA release this is bad. Game that gets Metascores 95/97 in 2022, should have way more work put into it. Next up is open world design - There's extreme amount of boring looking, absolutely empty areas. This is automatically bad open world design, because these empty areas, that doesn't even look good have zero purpose to be there. Other areas that actually have something, okay let's make that clear, all that other areas have is trees and monsters. Endless amount of monsters that are simply sitting there, doing nothing, waiting for you to slay them. This is literally Runescape game design 101, i have been playing Runescape since 2004, i know what i'm talking about. Quests (if you can even call them) are extremely short, boring and you can literally ignore all of them. It's usually some lady asking you to go somewhere, get something, get it back to her. Most hilarious thing is that game doesn't show that you have completed any of them, which basically means that by the end of the game, you forget that you even did these. Runescape has more complex lore, quests and writing than this game can only dream of. Why i'm talking about Runescape and not Skyrim, you might ask - Well because lore wise, Skyrim would be too tough challenger for this game. Combat is extremely similar to Dark Souls 3, game that released 6 years ago. Same animations, same everything. Anyone who says in that case that ""Innovation is overrated"" has no right to criticize Rockstar or Ubisoft ever again, just saying. Anyone who says that having horse is innovative must be a troll, because having this empty open world without any transportation, would be almost insulting. All in all very weak release, only fun i had in this whole game were two boss fights - Margit and Godrick, i have to say they have extremely unfair combos, attacks and they are pointlessly difficult to beat, especially for 2 first bosses, but at least they have some interesting lore and cool monster design. 1 point for beautiful sky design, 1 point for Margit boss design and 1 point for Godrick boss design. Overall score 3/10 - Not recommending, unless you have never played open world game before, but even then, you just could play older open world games that are way better.… Expand",3

Steam overlay causes issues with all kinds of games, not just Elden Ring. Just turn the dang thing off and watch your performance improve.  I did both of these things and have had 0 issues with frame rate, stuttering, or anything else that everyone is griping about. It is amazing to me how many PC Gamers don't do the basic maintenance of updating drivers to help their game and PC performance. The game itself is fantastic. It is the classic Dark Souls combat, mixed with an incredible open world with secrets and items to find EVERYWHERE. Literally their seems to be secrets and things to find on every inch of the massive map. Oh, and Boss fights galore. If you like Fromsoft games, then it is the perfect mesh of all their past games. The lore is great, and while there is a clear cut overarching ""quest"", most of the in-depth lore is still very cryptic and can be discovered through reading item descriptions in true Dark Souls fashion. I haven't been this into a video games in a lot of years. It ticks all the right boxes, is super addicting, and I find myself thinking about the items, worlds, bosses, and lore even when I am not playing it. It will forever be one of my top 5 gaming experiences, hands down. So to conclude, ignore the review bombers, update your PC, and enjoy one of the greatest games in recent memory.

I have beaten Demons Souls, Darks Souls 1-3, Bloodborne so I do have experience with prior Fromsoft games and have enjoyed them. The technical issues with the PC port have already been covered ad nauseum so I'll go over some of the other aspects of the game. Gameplay:Basically the same as Dark Souls 3 with a few minor changes: 1) addition of jump button, 2) addition of mount and very basic mounted combat, 3) addition of guard cancel, 4) weapon arts are now equippable (""ashes of war"" in Elden Ring). Veterans of the Souls series will feel right at home whereas the slower, calculated and methodical style of combat may take some getting used to for newcomers. Button mashing will get you killed very quickly in this game and even trash mobs can tear you apart. What was once revolutionary and spawned the whole subgenre of ""Soulslike"" games has become stale, predictable, and formulaic. Most of the enemies are reskins from the prior entries and in some cases, reused assets (eg. the giant crabs). Yes, the game is punishingly difficult but much of that difficulty is artificial from things like janky camera angles, busted hitboxes that pass through walls, gank squads in tight quarters, enemy projectiles defying the laws of physics, etc. Bosses attack relentlessly and you'll find yourself dodging for what feels like an eternity for a safe opportunity to counterattack, only to deal like 2% of their health. You'll likely die to greed, trying to get some more hits in on the boss because you're so bored of doing nothing but dodging yet another unending combo. For fans of the Souls series, this may be everything you wanted and for newcomers, this may still be fresh and exciting. For those who've played the Souls series and were hoping for some fresh gameplay, you won't find it here. World Design:The biggest change in Elden Ring from the Souls series is the introduction of an open world. For many, this is a breath of fresh air and one of their favourite features of Elden Ring. The world is massive and you can easily spend hours just exploring, opening up many possibilities for non-linear progression. Unfortunately for me, once I got passed the initial beauty of the world, I found it to be mostly empty and lifeless, and I found spending hours riding around on my mount looking for things to do tedious and boring. You will encounter random enemy mobs scattered throughout but the reward for killing them wasn't worth the effort so I just started riding around them. The optional dungeons I explored felt pointless, akin to the Chalice dungeons in Bloodborne. If you follow the recommended path through the game, you will likely be severely underleveled for the first main boss so exploration of optional content is clearly encouraged by design. Sadly, I don't find the exploration in Elden Ring to be interesting enough for the time investment required and this is the main reason why I don't plan on finishing Elden Ring, while I do plan on finishing DS3. However, many people love the aspect of exploration and discovery in Elden Ring so you may have a very different experience from me. Story:Like all the prior Souls titles, the story of Elden Ring is told cryptically in fragments mainly from NPC dialogue and item descriptions. George RR Martin was involved in the writing which I never would have guessed since the lore seems to basically be a reskin of the prior Souls titles. There are 1:1 equivalents for almost everything. The Elden Ring = First flame, Tarnished = chosen undead/ashen one, Site of Grace = Bonfire, Crimson Flask = Estus flask etc. Souls games have always required multiple playthroughs to unlock all the different endings and different NPC questlines to piece together the lore. The lore is often rich and interesting but I frankly don't have the time to go through the effort and will be watching some youtube lore videos to experience the story. Some people love this mysterious style of narrative and I enjoyed it with the prior Souls games as well. However, it really is just feeling like more of the same at this point and even the basic premise is similar to the prior games and I guess I was hoping for something fresh. Overall:Elden Ring is a very good game but isn't for everyone. Fans of the Souls series who just wanted more of the same will enjoy this and newcomers who don't mind the challenge will likely get sucked in as well. However, for players like me who enjoyed the Souls games but were expecting something new, Elden Ring falls shorts. Maybe I just don't like open world games? 7/10.… Expand",7

This would be acceptable for an SNES game, but we're far past that point. There are plenty of bugs, too; I have issues locking on vs certain enemies routinely. And last but certainly not least: the UI loves to get in your way. Oh sure don't tell me anything about how damage is calculated or what a spell actually does, but go ahead and lock me out of reacting in combat with a prompt that takes up a quarter of the screen and prevents me from making any meaningful actions in the middle of combat.Don't waste your time unless you enjoy getting tortured by mediocrity and artificial difficulty.… Expand",2

It sucks, and here is why: Main Story: There isn't one, after 200h the only thing that can be understood is that there is a stupid ring (G.R.R.'s courtesy), and that is it. You finish the game and there is no ring, you become ""Elden Lord"", whatever that means,After 120h of pure frustration and 200 level (at least 40-50 farmed), I give this game 2/10. The game is beaten solo (offline). It sucks, and here is why: Main Story: There isn't one, after 200h the only thing that can be understood is that there is a stupid ring (G.R.R.'s courtesy), and that is it. You finish the game and there is no ring, you become ""Elden Lord"", whatever that means, and that is it. Side Quests: Not a one normal quest that I will remember. No quest tracking, no map points, nothing. I've finished the game and missed 90% of the quests. Some of them I finished following various YT videos because I needed some gear, otherwise I wouldn't finish any of them. All quests expect players to spend tens of hours figuring out where will the quest character appear and when, and since the world is huge, that is a non-sense. The whole ""exhausting dialogs"" approach is stupid in many ways. Combat: Pure frustration. Dark Souls sheep that believe that dodging is a ""skill"", I pity them. Controlling your character feels like controlling an old dude who is lagging in every movement, and you are supposed to dodge with him in front of enemies with limitless stamina, 5+ hit combos and 5m-long weapons. Drinking potions is slow, so you need to dodge at least 5-7 times away from some enemies in order to be able to drink one potion without getting hit again. Most enemies use endless combos. It doesn't matter which level you are, if you go back to the beginning and find yourself between 2-3 enemies, you will die from couple of hits. It seems that your health is taken by percentage, almost every boss in the game will kill you in 3 hits at most. Waving with staff takes the same amount of stamina as hitting enemy with 3m hammer! Enemies: Great design for some enemies and bosses, and that's it, everything else about enemies is frustrated. Big bosses are stupid: locked camera goes crazy, hit box is not accurate. Some normal enemies are way harder than some bosses. All enemies are way agile than your old dude. Double bosses are stupid. Double stage bosses are even more stupid. Some bosses have enemies before it, each time you have to deal with them before entering boss area, because if you don't, you will get hit from back, or your summons will fight the enemies behind the barrier instead of boss. Difficulty: Nothing to say here, everybody knows it is kind of stupid difficulty that has nothing to do with the skills. I can only say that leveling up your character and coming back later is not fun at all. It makes you skip the content, the whole areas, the whole quests, and forgetting about them. Losing runes on death is just frustrating, it doesn't make the game any more difficult, it makes it longer because you will try to farm runes instead of playing the game. Open world: The design of the world is great, with wonderful scenes. The world is describing you its atmosphere graphically, whereas the music is not following that atmosphere at all. However, like many games, this one is also using open world to extend game's length in a lazy way. A lot of places have nothing, you are just traveling vast spaces without finding anything. Animations: Slow combat movement/drinking potion/opening doors/getting up when knocked down/bow attack, ... Controls: They chose the biggest idiot to make this port to PC. Never seen more stupid key bindings in any game, ever. How dafuq I am going to use E+ARROW KEY in the middle of a fight?! And don't tell me: ""You have to use joystick, bla, bla, ..."". If you are charging for PC game same as PS/XBOX, you should invest some time in adjusting it for PC. Have they just assigned random keys?! Then there is constant shuffling between spells, potions, weapons, ... Try doing that in front of boss that takes 90% of your health with one hit. I've died countless times because I shuffled wrong item. There is no consistency at all: sometimes you can use ESC to close something, something you must, sometimes you can't. Space for running instead of SHIFT like in every game?! G for map, why not M?! F for jump?! UI: Stupid Dark Souls recycled UI. It seems they copied everything they can from there. In a game where you die hundreds of times, you should be more creative with death message/animation, but they went with the lame ""YOU DIED"" for 100th time. Inventory management is painful. No pause! When you want to exit you are forced to see 2 logo animations again. Click ""any"" key to continue (except enter and space). Sound/music: I think there is one track throughout the whole game, and second one when somebody attacks you. And they both suck. I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody. This game feels like doing chores and not playing.… Expand",2

I don't need it to be life like for me to enjoy it(heck I still go back and play Atari games sometimes), but the graphics, while good, are no where near the quality of even God of War which came out over 4 years ago. Look no further that the fact that this released(and still as of this date) with no widescreen mode. If you have a nice curved 3440 monitor than this game will only serve to piss you off with the HUGE black bars on the sides. It has a bad problem with crashing constantly. It seems to happen the most when I use the map. No fix yet as of writing this. The need of a google search bar integrated into this game is a huge fault. I don't need my hand to be held with my games, but when I can't understand what something does and there is NO repository for it in the game, then there is a huge problem. There is ZERO quest tracking, not nearly enough info on what things do, the amount they do and the time in which they do said thing and no journal to look at to remember what's been said/done. This adds nothing to the game and in fact detracts from it to the point that it makes the Devs look extremely lazy, to not add even the most basic of info on things, or they did it to pad the games play time. The reuse of assets gets really bad after midgame, the same boss you fought earlier WILL make an appearance, it's not if they will, it's when. The multiplayer is straight garbage and is why I gave a 5/10 instead of a 7. The multiplayer, Hooo boy, where to begin...First, this is NOT a co-op game. It's a PvP game with co-op elements. You don't get to just hop in with a friend, Oh no, you have to furl a finger and wave some mist around first, and if your friend has beaten the boss of the area it's a no go, you can't join them. Also be prepared to get invaded by a guy who is maxed out on everything and is in new game + #16 with OP weapons and skills and 1 shots you, or someone lag switching and warping everywhere so your hits don't land but when they hit it's always a crit or backstab, or a straight up cheater who will invade just to corrupt your save so you have to start ALL over again. Sounds fun huh? Wanna play with just your friend and run around and have fun? Too bad! This is FROMSOFT BEEEE-OUCH! If I would have known how bad the horrible ""co-op"" mode is I would not have purchased the game. So no, this is FAR from GOTY and any 10/10 score. Take off the Fromsoft rose colored glasses and get a reality check if you think it is. Even with all this the single player mode is still pretty enjoyable, but these problems are, for some reason, completely overlooked because it's a ""Fromsoft/Souls like"" game by all these 10/10er's.

I'm dead serious, if that was the main appeal of gaming, i would have never even cared about video games, that's how much i dislike this game. Or maybe dislike is wrong word, maybe i just don't care about it at all and that would be okay, because there's thousands of games i don't care about, the problem is that God of War is treated by some people as something deep, amazing, innovative, masterpiece, one of the best games of all time, etc. I disagree strongy disagree with all these statements. It just isn't any of these thing, no matter how you look at this game. I have a strong feeling that people who hype this game up have never even played actual masterpieces like GTA 4 (2008), Resident Evil 4 (2005), Red Dead Redemption 1 and 2 (2010/2018). I can give examples even about ""just good"" games like for example Days Gone (2019), i enjoy that game about million times more and i think it's way, way more innovative than God of War 2018. Even Final Fantasy 7 Remake is better game than God of War 2018. So what's the deal? Why the hype? Is it just people following hype without even caring? With same logic Studios managed to create so big hype for Cyberbug2077, that even when it released as extremely buggy and broken mess, some people still refused to believe that it's bad and some to this day call Cyberpunk 2077 best game of all time, because they just can't handle reality after months (even years) of extreme hype. So what really is God of War 2018? It's a game with heavy focus on movie-like long cutscenes (not as bad as Uncharted 4, but still, a lot of cutscenes). Other aspect of this game is extremely simplistic, you just smash 100s of enemies with you EPIC axe. And of course there's boss fights with HUGE enemies, like in literally every modern game (not an issue by the way), just pointing out what this game is. So by that logics, where's Guardians of the Galaxy GOTY? It's basically the same game with guns as weapons. I'm asking that ironically, because none of these imo deserve to be called anything extraordinary, fun? Maybe. Nothing special tho. But here's the thing, these cutscene heavy, hack and slash games were never the reason why i started to play video games. Never. So to put it short, my main issue isn't the fact that these games exist, my issue is that God of War 2018 out of all these games is treated as something extraordinary, better than all the others, not even in same genre, people in general call it best game of all time. That is my issue. In my opinion there are so many better games, way deeper, way more gameplay and less cutscenes and to me it feels like, most of these God of War fans don't even know about these games.

I loved all the dialogues throughout the game and they talk pretty much all the time. The only issue I had with this game is the beggning, I think at the start the game is too difficult, even for me, a Souls series fan. You don't have many moves and you have to fight enemies that you don't have yet the tools to deal with them, like enemies that shoot projectiles but you don't have the skill to redirect their projectiles or you have to kill Nightmares but they need the Chaos Blade for easy killing or the Witches needs more arrows that Atreus have. But once you arrive at mid-game these problems simply go away and in the late game, the game becomes easy. BTW, I've played all the game on the 2nd hardest difficulty. Another thing that I really think they need to improve is the number of enemies, especially more epics bossies. This game has few bosses throughout the story, I think it is the GOW with the less quantity of epic bossies (Gods, Dragons, mythologic creatures). In the late game we can fight the nine Valkyries, but don't let this number fool you, their moveset is practically identical, they are just a cheap reskin. But the fight against them is really cool, it is a really good late-game challenge. It is a shame there aren't so many more bosses because the combat system is awesome.… Expand",9

Yıllardır övülen ama ps4'üm olmadığı için bir türlü deneyimleyemediğim bu eseri sonunda oynadım. Harika bir büyüme, baba-oğul, kendini bulma/tanıma hikayesi. Yola kendini ispatlama peşindeki bir oğlan olarak başlayan çocuğumuz, bu süreçte önce kendini kabul ettiriyor, sonra tanrı olduğunu öğrendiğinde kelimenin gerçek anlamıyla tanrı kompleksine girip yoldan çıkma eğilimi gösterirken babası tarafından tekrar disipline ediyor ve hak yolu buluyor. Çocuğun annesine, kendisine ve babasına dair gerçekleri öğrendikçe karakterinin değişmesi, gösterdiği tepkiler şahane. Çocuğumuza karşı soğuk ve otoriter bir baba olarak başladığımız hikaye, yol ve macera boyunca dönüşüme uğruyor. Sonunda onu bir savaşçı ancak daha fazlası bizden daha iyi bir varlık olarak kabul ediyoruz. Onu bir yandan savaşçı ve iyi biri olmak yolunda disipline ederken, bir yandan da kendine güvenmesini sağlıyoruz. Tabii o da bizi dönüştürüyor ve etrafımıza daha duyarlı birisi haline geliyoruz. Hakikaten birbirini pek tanımayan baba-oğul hikayesine şahane bir örnek. Oyun mekanik olarak da şahane. Combat'ta sadece 2 silah ve yumrukla yapılabilecek şeyler neredeyse sınırsız. Oyunun kaosun kılıçlarını size verme şekli, o anki atmosfer, o ana kadar hiç çaktırmaması falan efsane. Vuruşlar o kadar iyi görünüp tok duruyor ki gerçekten savaştaymışız gibi hissettiriyor. Vuruş hissi çok iyi yani. Geliştirmeler, skiller, geliştirmelerin sadece istatistiği artırmayıp aynı zamanda oynanışı da etkilemesi falan şahane. Bunun yanında deli gibi bir loot oyunu olmaması da yerinde olmuş. Açık dünyada yan görevler ve yapılacak etkinlikler bana az geldi. Dünyası da çok büyük değil zaten. Daha fazla ve hikayeli yan görev barındırıp daha geniş bir dünya olsa oyuna bir puan daha fazla verirdim. Tabii bu dünyası veya görevler sıkıcı ya da kendini tekrar ediyor demek değil. Oyun biraz metroidvania olduğundan, açık dünyayı keşfederken açamadığınız bir kapı ya da geçemediğiniz bir engeli ana hikayede ilerleyip edindiğiniz bir skill ya da eşya ile geçmeniz gerekiyor. Bu da her yeri keşfetmeye çalışmanıza ve sonunda kendinizi ödüllendirilmiş hissetmenize neden oluyor. Yan görevlerin hikayesi eh işte, ana görevlerin hikayesi çok güzel ama o da bana kısa geldi. Oyun tam da yeni ısınıyor dediğim noktada bitti. Ben Baldur'dan daha güçlü birileriyle, örneğin Thor'la kapışacağız ve baş düşmanımız o olacak sanıyordum. Oyunun bittiğine hakikaten çok şaşırdım. Henüz ortasında falanım sanıyordum. Çünkü diyar değiştirilen yerde daha gidilecek tonla yer vardı. Valkür'ler dışında pek bir boss savaşı yok. 2 defa Baldur'la 2 defa da Thor'un çocuklarıyla dövüşüyoruz. Ejderhayı saymıyorum bile, vadettiğinden daha azını veriyor. Düşman çeşitliliği fena değil. Ancak dövüş mekanikleri o kadar iyi ki boss'lara ve düşman çeşitliliğine dair tüm bu defektlere rağmen çok keyif alıyorsunuz. Bazen düşmanları öldürürken çıkan bitiriş animasyonları çok güzel, her düşman türü için farklı animasyon var, ancak o tür için sadece bir tane var. Bu da etkileyiciliği azaltıp, tekrar hissine neden oluyor. Oyun yan görev yaparken veya açık dünyada gezinirken ana hikayeden kopma problemini çok güzel gidermiş. Yanımızdaki kelle Mimir mitoloji ve oyunun evreni hakkında sürekli hikayeler anlatıp bilgiler vererek sizi bir şekilde oyunun içinde tutuyor. Oyunun optimizasyonu çok iyi. 3. parti oyunlar bile konsoldan pc'ye portlanırken özellikle çıkışının ilk bir ayında problem yaşatırken God of War ilk günden itibaren sorunsuz çalışıyor.

Set in the lands of the Norse Gods after Kratos pretty much wrecked the Greek world, Kratos has been living a quiet life with his wife and son. Naturally, by the time the game has started, his wife has died – apparently of natural causes – and she requests that KratosGod of War (2018) is the fourth – or perhaps like the eighth, depending on what you count – game in the God of War series. Set in the lands of the Norse Gods after Kratos pretty much wrecked the Greek world, Kratos has been living a quiet life with his wife and son. Naturally, by the time the game has started, his wife has died – apparently of natural causes – and she requests that Kratos and their son, Atreus, take her ashes to the top of the highest mountain in all the land to scatter them. Needless to say, things get a bit complicated, the Norse gods get involved, and before you know it you are off on an adventure through… well, the majority of the nine realms of Norse mythology, though in truth most of your adventure is in one realm (Midgard, i.e. the world of mortals) with your excursions to the other worlds little more than brief dungeons or series of challenges at most. The game is not enormously long, but it has a huge amount of side content which greatly stretches out its length. There’s a lot of places to explore and treasures to find, but the game is actually a bit short on actual monsters to fight. The problem is, the game actually runs out of new things to show you surprisingly early in its length. While there’s ostensibly a number of types of enemies, in reality there’s only a few actually different types – basically a very fast one that jumps on you, a standard melee trash mob, an enemy with a shield, an enemy with a big hammer, an enemy that throws ranged attacks at you, a teleporting witch, a big hulking ogre, a werewolf, trolls with big clubs, some flying enemies who shoot blinding things at you and then engage in melee, some other flying enemies who shoot things at you and sometimes buff enemies, and trolls. The game shows you all these types of enemies pretty early, though, and as a result, it feels like the game runs out of things to throw at you long before the game’s length ends. It doesn’t help that there’s really only five bosses apart from the trolls (which are very similar to each other) resulting in the game feeling like it is lacking for actually interesting combat content – which it kind of is. You fight some bosses multiple times (for story related reasons, but still) and unfortunately, it kind of becomes old hat by the end. The nine Valkyrie bosses do try to mix things up a bit themselves, and are the most interesting boss fights in the game, but they, too, get repetitive after a while. For all the spectacle that the game has, the game’s combat is honestly pretty mediocre – and that’s very unfortunate, because there is a fair amount of it. This is broken up by exploration, which is okay, but nothing super amazing – it’s pretty standard “puzzles”, but they’re all very simple and mostly are pretty much the same, just “the puzzle pieces are hidden differently”. Really, the only thing the game has to make it stand out from the competition is presentation – but fortunately, it does have that in spades. The voice acting is really good, the characters are fun to interact with (even if Kratos himself is mum about things for much of the game), and if you are a fan of Norse mythology, you can see all sorts of fun references in here, along with the game’s various twists and attempts to make the gods the bad guys (because, this is, after all, God of War, the series infamous for deicide – and while gods do die, you will likely be disappointed by the number, though fans of Norse Mythology will also be able to predict who is going to die and more or less how). The game’s core relationship – between Atreus and Kratos – works well, even if it is frustrating at times with just how taciturn Kratos is, but you can see how scarred Kratos is from his past experiences. The game, then, is about Kratos coming out of his shell a little while his son has to figure out who he is and what is going on. Atreus helps out in combat, and also helps with some puzzles, and while none of it is particularly spectacular in execution it works well enough. All in all, I felt like the game stretched itself out too long relative to its interesting content – it added two grindy sidequests for no good reason, as the combat is not anywhere near good enough to justify them, and it just adds to the length of the game without adding to the main thing that the game delivers on – the story of the relationship between Kratos and Atreus and their role in the world, including Kratos’ own undesired role, as he clearly detests his own nature as a god and fears what his son will be like when he realizes that he, too, is a son – trying to keep things as low-key as possible while avoiding giving too much away. All in all, the game's presentation saves its mediocre gameplay, and the side content is too often a boring distraction from the main thrust of the game.… Expand",7

Even onOne of the more compelling narratives in AAA gaming is marred by a confusingly awful balance pass. Normal difficulty is a boring cakewalk where the combat encounters outside of boss fights are annoyances that just slow down the story. But if you want more interesting and aggressive enemies, turning up the difficulty does that... but also drastically inflates their health bars. Even on Hard, a single normal enemy can take upwards of ten hits to kill, and this is a game where you will often fight groups of five or more enemies at a time, in multiple waves. It's the absolute worst form of difficulty inflation, which is so puzzling because they *also* make the enemies smarter and more interesting to fight! Why is this how it is? If the devs really think anyone wants every enemy in the game to be a damage sponge, they should have made a difficulty menu where you can mix and match options, or at least add a couple more difficulty settings so there could be one that's ""interesting fights that don't last for ten minutes each"". Don't even get me started on the hardest difficulty, which for some completely unjustifiable reason *locks you out of changing difficulty*. This is common in older games, but here it's blatantly done deliberately because you can freely switch between the others. I'm pretty sure this was done for no other reason than to stir up hype in the hardcore gaming scene, but if the intent is to reference properly hard games like Dark Souls, they really screwed the pooch, because the balancing here is absolutely atrocious. This mode has the most interesting combat mechanics, stuff you literally can't even see in the other modes, but once again if you want that intense experience you also have to deal with normal enemies who have health bars literally bigger than the first boss on normal. If you don't care about gameplay, this is a good story. But I'm not sure it's worth slogging through the combat in any of the available configurations.… Expand",6

I thoroughly enjoyed the first Rogue Legacy many years ago, and was worried that the sequel would fail to follow its footprints, as many do nowadays. However, this fear was quickly relieved within an hour of play. This game improves upon essentially everything from the first - more unique worlds, far more diverse classes that all feel viable, and much more customization and variety from run to run. You can get as much out of this game as you want - whether that be a single run to get the first ending - or hundreds of hours of enjoyment (with the occasional swing of devastation). And better yet, you can play through the game at your own pace with the customization options known as ""House Rules"" (enemy hp, damage dealt/taken, contact damage, etc.), if you aren't the hardcore kind of game. TL;DR - Rogue Legacy 2 expands on all the good things from the original and adds much more new stuff with it.

Other than 2 new endings, about 1,5h of new content, and, well, 2x more new endings after completing ""New Content"" it adds really important Epilogue, and everything after it.Well, I just said what adds UD, but here is a question: What is Stanley Parable?Stanley Parable is a game about choices. It's a game about a person named Stanley. Its a game about Narrator and him being scared his work won't be loved. And most importantly: It's a story about control.But from gameplay perspective, its a game about exploring office, and making choices that have different endings. Narrator talks straightforward with Stanley and/or player, and breaks the 4th wall many, many times.Its really funny, it's really creative, it's really good. You should play it. I finished in about 8h, but there are people with much more on their timer (like 14-6h), and even I can find some new content (as a guy who played the original).So, umm, I hope you liked the review, its my first ""big one"". Buy the game, Have good time, And see you later. edit:I readed some negative steam reviews. I'm suprised because some of them have a really good point (some, most are just saying ""too little new things"" after 0,5h, or too expensive), And I wanted to address those reviews. So, all of them are from fans of the original. That is very important. They criticize two things: The new content is just worse old content without a soul, and that its a bad satire.As to the first argument: It's just wrong. The new content is as good as the old one, sometimes even better. Like, half of my favorite ending are from UD and half from Original.Simply: Nostalgia is powerful.And the second argument, is, more complicated. I am a person who, apart from PS4 Exclusives (and mgs/r) doesn't play a lot of typical AAA. And with that I'm not good with answering the question: What makes a good sequel. There are many games that have another parts same as old ones with new settings and minor changes in gameplay (Ubisoft moment), and some others with super big changes, like fighing games. (just look at Guilty Gear). So overall, this may be an argument, but imo it's not a reason to say that game is bad.Well, that was long, and nobody will read it, sadly, so umm, Have a good day!… Expand",10

Но пару раз усмехнуться от здешней метаиронии можно. И сколько бы авторы сами себя не стебали, что типо ""шедевру не нужна расширенная версия"", зачем что-то лишнее, но ведь действительно, так и получилось) Особой надобности проходить эту часть я не нашёл, да, можно найти щепотку философии, или посмеяться (слушать полный бред, говорящийся на серьёзных щшах - это фишка SP), но ""не фанат таких игр"" ничего не потеряет, если пройдёт только оригинал) Нового контента™ тут часа на 4. Движок тут, кстати, изменили с Source на Unity, но всё выглядит идентично, атмосфера не потеряна. Вообще, для тех, кто не знает, оригинальная Стенли Парабл - это уникальная сюжетная игра с 20+ концовками, рассуждающая о том, как игроки желают бесконечно отыскивать бесполезные для них секреты, или делать что-то, противоречащее основному ходу игры, просто чтобы сделать, без всякого смысла, просто потому что кто-то заложил это в игру, значит ты должен это открыть, рассуждающая о том, что игрок заперт в игре без выбора, при этом дающая ему иллюзорные ""альтернативные"" пути истории, которые точно также спланированы для него. Причём тут у нас ещё и ломание 4-ой стены, и рассказчик, и, даже, наверное, сама игра, как отдельные личности)Крче, такого вы больше нигде не найдёте, просто попробуйте) Единственный субъективный минус игры в том, что она не очень динамичная и по-настоящему ярких или экшоновых концовок мало, но если у вас есть хоть капля терпения, когда вы играете в игры, то проблем не будет. В оригинальной игре было что-то около 24 концовок, тут я прошёл (вместе с оригинальными) - 36. Подписывайтесь на Кураторство в Steam: https://store.steampowered.com/curator/37365104… Expand",8

Neon White not only encourages improvement with tight level design & easy to grasp mechanics, it makes you feel like a badass every time you get an ace trophy after dominating a stage, & it does not get old. On the other hand, If you play games for the story then unfortunately all Neon White has to offer are a mixed bag of vocal performances, stiff & sometimes cringeworthy dialogue & a story that doesn't exactly break new ground in any way. The writing style in this game reminds me of the Danganronpa series, but not for any of the positive aspects Danganronpa may have. All in all, if you enjoy the dopamine rush of effortlessly clearing a stage that you've come to know like the back of your hand in an experience a la Doom Eternal, then Neon White will leave you more than satisfied.

This review will be about my experience as opposed to a through review. Out of all the Slabs that give you your powers, the only ones that I really used were teleportation and invisibility. I wish I was able to use all of them like in some past Arkane titles but sadly you can only equip 2 at a time. You can however swap out powers at your base in between missions. I was concerned about the Juliana character that invades your game every so often. I set my game to single player and found the AI Juliana fairly easy to kill. In fact out of the many times I fought her she only won once. She only appears on maps where your visionary targets are. No visionary on the map means you can explore with no worries about being jumped by her. I would have preferred no Juliana interruptions but found the great loot she drops worth a bit of a tangle with her. I played stealthy. I upgraded the teleport ability so it freezes time for a moment after a jump, making targeting hard to reach places easier, I also extended its reach. I also upgraded the invisibility ability so that shooting does not break it and made it so that it uses no power when I was not moving. I mainly used a silenced weapon that would refill a portion of my power meter after each headshot. So basically I would find an elevated position with a clear line of sight of the enemies, go invisible and get headshot after headshot with each shot recharging my invisibility. Basically becomes a god mode. When fighting visionaries or Juliana I used hard hitting weapons that drain their health and power rendering them easier to take down. In the end you have to kill all 7 visionaries in one loop/day. Sadly it is not like the Hitman franchise where your targets can be dealt with in a number of ways. I am not saying there is no room to get creative with your kills, but there is not much. With that said, I really enjoyed Deathloop and hope they come up with a sequel.… Expand",8

Most gameplay mechanics felt like failed experimentation and some exploration segments also felt less rewarding. The lack of voice acting was also detrimental to the experience.,7

857,Another one of these games that critics praise for NO reason. This game is pathetic really. Boring from start to finish. The plot barely makes sense and is on the level of something that L.

The combat is boring and repetitive. When I pay $60, I expect a combat system with depth and detail. All the developers did in this game is put pretty lights during every move, to give players the illusion that the game is fun. None of that is fun for me. The physics are beyond horrible. The splash physics don't look as good as they do in the cutscenes. The animations are laughable. It says on the back of the game case to explore. What is there to explore in this game? It is the exact same trash as 90 percent of modern open world games. Just a boring and empty landscape full of grass, rocks, and vegetation. Why would I want to explore that? Why can't I explore the village that is in the intro cutscene instead? Developers these days are so cheap and lazy, they can't even be bothered to make enough villages or man-made environments, because it's easier to copy and paste grass everywhere. Speaking of grass, it doesn't even react to the player's movement. The characters are so annoying. They keep repeating the same lines over and over again when attacking enemies. Boss battles are lazily designed and so are the side quests. There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is literally not a reason to play this game again. Charging $60 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. For goodness sake, why are video game developers so obsessed with the word Chronicles? Enough already.

Unisce ed equilibra elementi di gameplay e di narrazione dei capitoli precedenti, tra cui elementi che portati all'estremo potevano risultare poco opportuni in alcuneXenoblade Chronicles 3, l'ultima fatica di Tetsuya Takahashi e Monolith Soft, è semplicemente la perfezione. È il risultato e il connubio definitivo di tutto quello che abbiamo visto nella serie di Xenoblade Chronicles. Unisce ed equilibra elementi di gameplay e di narrazione dei capitoli precedenti, tra cui elementi che portati all'estremo potevano risultare poco opportuni in alcune occasioni, come l'eccessiva serietà del primo capitolo o la troppa leggerezza del secondo. La Storia di Xenoblade Chronicles 3 è qualcosa di fuori scala, introducendo e raccontandoti un argomento che ti accompagnerà per tutta l'avventura, dallo spessore e una profondità indescrivibile: il peso della vita. Gli Agnus e i Keves, popolani di Aionios che si distribuiscono in colonie combattenti, si scontrano da tempi immemori, rubandosi la vita a vicenda, perché è l'unico modo che conoscono per vivere, e l'unico modo in cui sono costretti a farlo: combattere per vivere e vivere per combattere. Noah e i suoi compagni dovranno viaggiare ed affrontare innumerevoli difficoltà per trovare la verità e le motivazioni che hanno reso Aionios, il loro mondo, così contorto e ingiusto. Con loro portano una speranza per il futuro, la speranza di creare un mondo migliore per loro e tutti gli abitanti di Aionios. Le mappe di Xenoblade Chronicles 3 sono sconfinate e meravigliose, con una profondità di campo impressionante, e panorami che tolgono il fiato. Ogni luogo è ben caratterizzato e reso meravigliosamente, nonostante i limiti tecnici di Nintendo Switch. Un encomio da fare è anche per la musica, composta principalmente dall'illustre Yasunori Mitsuda, e da altri grandi artisti, che hanno dato luce a centinaia di colonne sonore memorabili e dalla qualità indiscutibile. I Protagonisti di Xenoblade Chronicles 3 sono caratterizzati divinamente: Noah, Mio, Yunie, Taion, Lanz e Sena sono molto diversi tra di loro, ma impareranno a conoscersi, e imparerai tu a conoscere loro, nel corso del loro lunghissimo viaggio. Arriverai a considerarli dei cari amici, dato che ogni loro azione, anche la più futile, ti farà conoscere una loro nuova sfaccettatura. Una chiacchera in un punto di riposo, come ognuno di loro si interfaccia alle varie quest secondarie o come reagiscono a particolari elementi del mondo che li circonda. Il Combat System di Xenoblade Chronicles 3 è stratificato, complesso e stimolante, che non è per tutti, ma che obiettivamente è veramente ben realizzato: i 6 protagonisti sono tutti in campo e combattono in tempo reale, controllabili uno alla volta. A compensare l'attacco ""normale"" che è automatico, devono concatenare mosse speciali e abilità che si basano principalmente sulla posizione del singolo personaggio o dell'effetto di cui può beneficiare spesso tutta la squadra. Le classi sono principalmente 3: attaccante, difensore e guaritore. Le classi sono varie e intercambiabili, e sono solo una piccola parte delle feature del combat system, che presenta anche le forme Ouroboros, giganti robotici risultanti della fusione tra 2 dei 6 protagonisti. Le Quest di Xenoblade Chronicles 3 sono fondamentali per il World Building del gioco, sempre interessanti e ragionate. Si distinguono poi dalle quest normali le quest per Eroi, che si incentrano su specifici personaggi, principalmente Comandanti di Colonie, che finiranno per unirsi volentieri alla tua causa e, uno per volta alla tua squadra, come settimi membri aggiuntivi e non controllabili. Le Quest degli Eroi sono importanti e portano spesso alla scoperta di intere nuove colonie ed aree, rendendo la voglia di completismo stimolante e gratificante. Xenoblade Chronicles 3 è in parole povere, un gioco monumentale, un capolavoro, e lo sforzo definitivo di Monolith Soft, con tutta l'esperienza e i pregi ricavati dai precedenti capitoli della serie. Rientra senza riserve tra i migliori J-RPG della storia e merita un occasione, anche da chi non mastica il genere.… Expand",10

Without getting into too much detail or spoilers there is just a few caveats to the game that hinders it to have a perfect score, like the fact that all initial tutorials are vast and not skippable. Now for the goods things: The combat mechanic is mostly unchanged from previous games, in fact, it feels like a combination of Xenoblade 1, 2 and Torna DLC, while also simplifying its chain attack functionality. Leveling became non tedious thanks to the existence of new mob category (ELITE) which grants a minimum of 150% EXP bonus, combined this with overkill, a chain attack function which adds a 300% EXP bonus and you have the recipe of easy leveling. Story is very intriguing and it doesn't shy away from the concepts of betray, grief, despair, death and fear. it shows a very crude reality of war, while also introducing concepts of existentialism something that most Xeno series include on their stories. Overall, its a well rounded story, gameplay is smooth and dynamic, cinematics are incredibly filled with emotion from the characters involved, and the game engine can handle heavy amounts of passive and aggressive NPC without feeling slow or stuttering, making its vast world feel alive and not empty at all.… Expand",10

Tons of duplicate accessories that range from low quality to legendary, tho there can be low quality accessories that are +30% attack and then legendary that are + 20% attack this makes 0 senseAnd they have different names even tho they do the same thing, this making inventory sorting a pain as you can't sort by type only by name, ordervalue.Changing classes is fun but visually boring previous game had tons of unique blades and armour options. This just slaps on robes and trinkets on your base costume with few exceptions you look the same. Graphics = 4 it's just plain ugly for a new game in 22 when other games push billions of triangles hirez textures raytracing.

However, Xenoblade 3 tops it with so much more refinement, story, gameplay, and world. Pros: - World is absolutely huge, and I mean huge, the first big region you encounter in this game can be its own open world game in its own right, for reference, combine all the regions in Pokemon Legends Arceus, and it still won't be half as big as this one singular region of multiple regions in this game! - Story is of a darker tone and is incredible writing, many people disliked the tone in some scenes of two, there is none of that in this game, but there are still many lighthearted moments where it still feels natural to the setting of the game and characters. - Main characters are great and all have their big part to play in the story, well developed. - Voice directing is much better, the whole English cast did a great job in the game, and for a JRPG, the English dub is one of the better dubs for this genre. Amiee Ffion Edwards (Mio) does a remarkable job. - Combat is the best in the series, easier to get into compared to 2, and there is a lot of customization and playstyles to suit your need, you will notice that you will end up playing with all the characters throughout the game instead of one due to the mechanics and class learning. - The horrid fetch quests are mostly now tied to a particular collectpedia card feature which is a nice QoL change Cons - Default sound settings need to be adjusted as the music can be too loud for when the characters talk which means you are forced to read the subtitles, this is a reoccurring trait with Xeno games. In- Early game it is quite easy to become over-leveled if you are out exploring and doing some quests, but this changes the later you get into the game.… Expand",10

The writing and dialogue is shockingly bad most of the time, the villains are cartoonishly evil, characters just suddenly completely change their minds with no morivation, don't give necessary info or do not even sort of react to things that should completely wreck them. It badly breaks immersion in the story because it starts off very interesting but the dialogue tanks it. Then combat, it's very fun and addictive but my huge issue is the AI for companions, it's very bad and basically forces you to play healer in any non-trash fight because the AI will not use their skills right and you will die constantly because of it if you are not focused on playing a healer.There are issues with the game crashing as well, I've had my game crash 3 times so far at chapter 5. There is also a problem with overleveling, you can very easily get too high level and it not only trivializes story content and makes it boring, but you cannot gain class ranks or unlock classes on other party members if you fight enemies more than 3-4 levels below yours so you can have long stretches of story where you are not able to progress your classes because you accidentally leveled up , and sometimes it levels you up during battles, not manually at campfires, so with no way to lower your level it can really screw up the experience. Just to demonstrate how easy it is for this to happen, I just went and did all the question marks on the map indicating quests that unlock new classes, not even all the regular side quests, then went back to the story at level 48 when the main story had a recommended level of 27, most levels were not manual, and the game did not indicate that you would not get class progress if you leveled too much, so the only way to avoid this would have been to skip getting new classes or running from all unnecessary battles avoiding everything like supply drops or those bouts where you pick a side.That said, the plot hook is interesting even if the execution is kind of a mess and it is very fun still so I would still recommend it, but it's not the masterpiece some people are acting like it is, it needs some big fixes.… Expand",7

Ultimately, The Delicious Last Course is meant to essentially be more Cuphead, and I, for one, am glad for that. The Delicious Last Course adds great new fights, and interesting new characters, and an interesting secret to figure out. Cuphead: The Delicious Last Course is the perfect example of how a DLC or expansion doesn’t really have to reinvent the wheel; it just has to remember what made people love the base game to begin with, and expand on those concepts. The Delicious Last Course is basically a must-buy for anyone who likes Cuphead, but it’s also worth keeping an eye on if you just like great side-scrolling action.… Expand",9

But other than that the whole thing feels decidedly meh. The combat plays like an ersatz version of Devil May Cry, with far less aerial combat and enemy juggling and worse player and camera controls. Enemy encounters often turn into a frustrating bullet hell, with a wonky camera that at times feels like an extra opponent. Combat also suffers from a lack of verticality and options for fast traversal, and enemies feel kind of same-y. I died quite often, I'd say more or less as frequently as when I play dark souls. The difference is that the deaths in Nier: Automata never once felt fair, and beating the harder enemies never once felt satisfying. Maybe there's depth to be found here, but I sure haven't been able to find any. This is not helped by the fact that the game's plethora of systems are hardly explained. How do you play the fishing mini game, and what's the point of it? Who knows! How does one use the various installable module thingies? No idea, the game never tells me. What are the various resources and random things I collect? Can I use them for something? Is there crafting? Beats me. Heck, I didn't even know there were healing potions for a good several hours because the game never explained that this was a thing. Lastly, the aethethics are a mixed bag. Graphics are okay for it being a switch game, and the enemies are generally well designed. The world is also generally beautiful, albeit not that exciting. Our heroine, however… I get that it's a thing they're going for, but the bleak and sombre tone of the story is rather at odds with the fact that the protagonist – supposedly a rugged soldier – runs around in some kind of maid outfit that gratuitously displays her naked butt whenever the camera is at a low angle. Had they gone for a comedic ecchi vibe, or a tone similar to e.g. Bayonetta, it would have been at least consistent. But in this game it just makes for a weird cognitive dissonance.… Expand",6

Sometimes it’s aNier Automata is one among the handful of titles that I cite in example to describe what the medium can achieve when all the components of a game gel into a cohesive experience. Story focused games sometimes forget their first mandate, the gameplay. Other times it’s masterful mechanics wasted on a game that struggles to give a proper motivation and context to the player. Sometimes it’s a lackluster art direction that robs the game of its full potential. Nier Automata doesn’t have any of these problems. It’s an unforgettable experience told in a very clever and unique way, supported by satisfying action, meaningful progression, and superb production values. Usually I’m not one for praising the story in a game, but in this case I must mention the compelling, sometimes downright touching characters (in particular among the machines), and the emotional impact of their story, which is told with economy, suggested at times, and certainly never hamfisted. The game isn’t burried under useless dialogue. Every character interaction is meaningful and concise, a fact quite rare among JRPGs.  I also want to salute the unusual structure of the game, where the full experience is distilled though several play throughs. This ensures enjoyable replay value, devoid of grind, and a system that keeps peeling new layers, and rewards the most dedicated player. I could go on for a long time, telling you about the impeccable mechanics, the atmospheric art direction, the powerful music. But I want to adress the port. In fact, it’s the quality of the Switch port that compelled me to write a review. I’ve played the game on PS4, and of course if you own one, it’s a better way to experience the game. But with a solid 30 fps most of the time and clever graphical compromises, this port is as good as they get. I think we need to encourage developers to treat the Switch with respect, and boycott shameless cash grab half baked ports. They’re an insult  both to the platform and the game. But rest assured that if you can only play Nier Automata on the Switch, the core of the experience remains intact, and the few concessions the developer made are quite reasonable. The only questionable choice for me is how much more saturated the game is on Switch. I have nothing against colorful games, but I think that the somewhat subdued palette on PS4 felt more appropriate. I’m not sure if this was a conscious choice, but to me it cheapens the art, and gives the game an unwanted peppy look. However this is a minor concern, especially  if you’ve never played the game on any other platform. But if like me you’re sensitive to this kind of thing, it’s a bit of an issue. For my part, I’ll play Nier Automata again, because it’s a true testament to how wonderful videogames can be, both for their entertainment and artistic value. And I suggest that you do the same.… Expand",8

Creo que poco se habla de ellos, ya que siempre he escuchado a todo el mundo deshacerse en halagos unicamente, y estos fallos hacen que el juego no sea para todo el mundo. Nier: Automata es principalmente un action JRPG, pero que mezcla una gran cantidad de otros generos (shooters, puzzles, arcade...). Esto es un punto a favor en el sentido de la variedad, pero hay momentos que puede resultar molesto e incluso romper el ritmo... no me malentendais, la acción esta pulida y el juego se maneja de maravilla.En segundo lugar, las quests pueden acabar siendo molestas a pesar de ser interesantes sus historias. El punto principal es que conllevan perder una cantidad considerable realizando tareas que acaban siendo repetitivas. Por supuesto que no son necesarias, pero este es un juego que te impulsa a completarlo para desentrañar realmente la historia (y ahi el problema de las conexiones con los juegos pasados). Y algo aún peor, completar la colección o la fusión de chips. Ninguna de las dos cosas es necesaria para completar el juego... al menos no al 100%, pero por ejemplo, si que necesitaremos completar la lista de enemigos al menos al 95%, y eso significa perder cantidades ingentes de tiempo buscando a enemigos realmente raros, que a no ser que tengamos una guía no sabremos ni donde encontrar (y esto es otro problema). Y los chips, aunque no son necesarios, son nuestra forma de mejorar a nuestro personaje, y en última instancia queda completamente al azar el que los enemigos suelten chips diamante de bajo coste (los únicos que merecen la pena) para que podamos ir fusionándolos y conseguir chips utilizables. No es realmente necesario como digo, pero si molesto. También, por razones de historia que tampoco tienen mucho sentido, hay ciertas características bloqueadas hasta llegar a cierto punto en la historia, y especialmente el bloqueo del teletransporte es un coñazo que nos obliga a perder el tiempo pateando el mapa para realizar las quests secundarias. Me he centrado en decir lo negativo porque siento que nadie se molesta en hacerlo. Dejando lo dicho arriba de lado, este es un juego que merece mucho la pena y que busca sorprenderte y romper todo aquello que tienes por prestablecido. Algunos giros de guión se ven venir de lejos, otros no tanto... extremadamente recomendable.… Expand",8

That mean if you don't get it, you don't get it. You walk, sometimes you can interact with objects and buttons, and that's all folks. To fully understand The stanley parable, one of the first scene is perfect. ""You have two doors in front of you. The narrator says you going to take the left door. Do you really want to take the left door or are you betray the narrator and try the one on your right ?"" That's all the magic of the game. The respect or the direspect of the narrator. The more you play, the more you find ways to challenge the narrator. Fun to play and really original.But what's new in The stanley parable : Ultra Deluxe ? Absolutely everything. The 2013's version is still one of my most iconic play in life. And i thanks me for playing the Ultra Deluxe at day one to avoid spoiler. Ultra Deluxe is presented as a remake from the 2013's version, with new content added. I'm not going to spoil.But the fact that you'll find all the orignal Stanley Parable content, the Ultra Deluxe content and the smartest surprises you'll ever find in a videogame... makes this game a real love letter to the game and the fans of the first episode. I enjoyed the time and felt rewarwed by the dev.I'm not spoiling everything. If you liked the first one you NEED to do this one. If you never played the first Stanley Parable, just go for it. Try it.

He has 10 days before judgement in which he has to become the #1 demon slayer in order to stay in heaven. The story is fun and exciting, but I'm not really a fan of how blatantly sexualized the dialogue between White and the main female characters is since it feels fanfiction-y and awkward. Regardless, the story overall is great world dressing for the gameplay.The gameplay in Neon White is unlike anything I've ever seen. It's a first-person platformer/shooter where you speedrun levels using playing cards as your weapons which you can discard to use numerous different abilities such as a forward dash, an upwards boost, a bomb, and many more. All of these elements blend perfectly into each other as I entered a flow state using all of my accumulated skills to flawlessly pull off the fastest runs possible in each level before moving on. Not only are there these addictive platforming missions, but there are also light visual novel/dating sim elements that you can enjoy at your leisure in between missions. These help break up the pace and give you more time with the game's characters and story before jumping right back into the action.The soundtrack of Neon White is also addictive and I can't credit Machine Girl enough for their work. It sets a very unique vibe that reminds me of the Splatoon campaign level music with its sporatic style.Neon White's visuals are also fantastic. Simplistic in their design yet flawlessly executed. Every heavenly structure frames exciting levels that run at a nearly solid 60fps as far as I can tell.Overall, I'd strongly recommend Neon White to anyone who loves going fast in video games and wants something unlike they've ever played before!… Expand",9

First, I need to say that what got me into this game was the soundtrack. It's just PERFECT! Not a single bad song. Songs to keep the rush going, calm songs, stylish songsDo not sleep on this game!Neon White is definitely one of the best games of the year and surely one that I wasn't expecting to get me like it did. It has plenty of flaws, but it makes up for it with HUGE fun factor. First, I need to say that what got me into this game was the soundtrack. It's just PERFECT! Not a single bad song. Songs to keep the rush going, calm songs, stylish songs and so on. If you don't get your hands on this game, at least go for the music.And this sick soundtrack matches perfectly with Neon White's sick gameplay. Everything just flows amazingly well. You feel the rush, you want to go fast and when you accomplish it, you see yourself as this bad ass player. I'm not a guy who usually goes for record times and collectibles, but it's so fun to traverse through these VERY well-designed levels that I just went for whatever I could get, again and again. It is addictive and will keep you there. One thing I was worried about after picking up the game was the story. But I'm happy to say that it's actually pretty fun.I really liked the character design and voice acting, but the whacky writing and so-so jokes kept me a bit on the edge about it. But as the story proggresses, you start to figure the plot out and comprehend character motives and personality. It's not incredibly engaging, but it's interesting. Especially with characters as charismatic as Mikey, or nice the nice relationship development of White & Red's. By the end, I was satisfied with what I experienced. But while Neon White gets a lot of things right, some of its cracks are right there, preventing it from being better than it is.After chapter 6, there's a weird shift. The difficulty spike is HUGE and, while I did not find anything unfair, it did cut back the perfect flow and paciong built up from its very first level. Some of the new obstacles on late game levels were just a chore. There were levels that were either completely focused on shooting demons rather than quick traversal, or extremely long. That happens a lot and it sucks, because Neon White is at its best when it's fast as **** not trying to be a shooter. Some other things also bothered me. The presentation could've been better, they could've cut back the amount of useless dialogue, there are more gifts than there should be, late sidequests were a little too Celeste for me and the few boss fights in the game weren't as thrilling as I thought they could be (especially the 2nd one).And at last, but definitely not least, aiming is HORRIBLE on Switch. It works a little better when you mess around with aim assist and sensitivity, but it was the reason why I failed a lot of the more ""shooter"" focused levels. Don't even get me started on the Dominion card levels. If you can, play this with a mouse and keyboard. Neon White is an EXTREMELY fun game. It may not be consistent from beginning to end, but it works a lot more than it doesn't.Do not be discouraged by its weird presentation and writing. Dive right in and I'm sure you will not want to leave.… Expand",8

This is not a review of the price of the game because that is stupid - if it’s more expensive than what you’re willing to pay, then don’t buy it.The game aged decently, but I wouldn’t say it aged well. Truthfully even in this remastered version, it still feels like you’re playing a PS3 game. Some of the mechanics, animations, fluidity, and AI feel a bit clunky. Not unplayable or hugely immersion breaking, but definitely noticeable when you can’t leave a room when your NPC companion is standing in the doorway. This would have been a far better release if they added the fluid gameplay and AI from the second game. Regardless, it doesn’t take away from the game. So essentially the only difference here are the graphics, which really do look excellent. Visually the game doesn’t stand out on top of the pack of next gen games, but it’s definitely on par where it should be.

On est sur un vrai remake car graphiquement, tout est retravaillé, chaque décor, chaque détail, lumière, caméra etc(Accrochez vous pour trouver plus joli) Également, le gameplay est beaucoup plus fluide, il suffit de rejouer à l’ancienne version pour s’en rendre compte, certes ce n’est pas celui du 2 (évident car le jeu ne dispose pas de la même architecture verticale) mais on s’en rapproche sur l’usage de certaines armes, la prises en main en courses de Briques, Bouteilles… la facilité à enchaîner les morts comme dans le 2 (je joue en difficile) L’arsenal a été enrichi, les mises à mort également… aucune faiblesse à signaler, et ce pour les simples raisons que le jeu est meilleur que tout autre sur le plan graphique, le gameplay est fluide et facile d’accès, efficace et propose de l’action autant que de l’infiltration. Tout est question de choix. Les animations, le sound design, l’angoisse, tout est là, aucun bug, je dis bien AUCUN bug de tout le jeu. Certains parle du prix mais le prix est le prix d’un jeu.

Le prix ne sera jamais un point faible, car le prix varie tandis que la qualité reste et surtout le prix est indépendant du développement et du résultat final du jeu. Un blu ray ne coûte pas moins chère qu’un DVD et ce même si on l’a déjà vu. Un jeu PS5 aujourd’hui c’est 79€ et c’est le bris de The last of us. Si le prix est jugé trop élevé ce n’est pas lié à The last of us mais au prix établi d’un jeu PS5.

They could have been included in the PS4, or even the PS3 version of the game in a free update.B) Even if they called it what it is, a remaster, why do we need another remaster of a game that has already been remastered?

Let it sink in, and take notes- it'll be rewarded. The game is literally too dense and too long to binge reasonably if you like 100%ing.2. Get invested in the characters and pay attention to them, not just the (admittedly stellar) mysteries.3. Explore the game, its mechanics, and its dialogue yourself. Don't be afraid to restart a Somnium several times; the more options you pick, the more meaningful information you get.4. If you're a puzzle lover then try to solve the game yourself. You're going to have a blast if you manage it, and the game has tons of built-in hint systems to make it even easier, fairer, and more fun.5. Try to go in knowing at little as you can. The marketing has already done a great job. Focus on finishing the game and bringing it all together.6. On PC, force anti-aliasing on using your graphics card to make the game prettier. Game ran and controlled smoothly with few bugs.7. You don't need AI1 to play AI2, but I think AI2 does spoil AI1, though you could still enjoy them in reverse order.7.

I've played all his English-translated games, and visual novels are my favorite genre of game. I've played a lot of visuals novels, but Uchizawa's are my favorites. This is what I value in games:A. An interesting storyB. Bunches of novel ideas like unique plot points I haven't seen before, philosophical ideas, or puzzlesC. Characters that I at least don't actively hateD. Deep personal connection, usually formed by connections to real people or how a game shaped my lifeFor the last 8 years, my top 2 favorite games have been the same:My top favorite game of all time is Remember11. I love the plot, the ideas, the twists, the characters, and it's what got me truly invested in Uchikoshi. It's very much a mystery game first with an unravelling mystery and themes I love to explore. My second favorite game is Virtue's Last Reward. I love the interactive moral dilemmas. VLR's use of the Prisoner's Dilemma jumpstarted my interested in Philosophy which led me to major in Philosophy. I don't like the characters as much, but it's still very important to me.Part 3: My ReviewThe R11 #1 and VLR #2 favorite game holy duology held true for 8 years. Also, AI1 isn't one of my favorite standalone games; it has huge personal connection for me because of the community and the AI1 ARG, but it wasn't my favorite as a game.I gave all that background because I want you to take me seriously when I say this:AI2 is my new favorite game. The #1 spot has been Easily dethroned.The themes, twists, characters, ideas, gameplay, visuals, voice acting, fair mystery, presentation, mechanics, and comedy all of it resonates together perfectly. I don't even tend to value gameplay or visuals, but at many times, this game is fun to play while looking genuinely beautiful and cinematic.The story reads like a proper Uchikoshi + Nakazawa return to form. The mystery is fair, interesting, meaningful, and complex told satisfyingly. There are many deep ideas, concepts, and themes utilized in thought-provoking ways.Gameplay-wise, there are tons of mechanics that are utilized to make each Somnium unique; they all feel designed by love, fair, and reflective of the character through gorgeous symbolism. They blow the first game completely out of the water. Each one is its own experience to explore and a visual delight. There are also tons of mechanics for you to discover that make AI2 a fun game to play.The animations, voices, and directing are cinematic; this game is actually breathtaking a lot of the time. It's backed up by great and charming character writing- despite the fact Mizuki is my favorite AI1 character with 0 contest, I grew to like much of the AI2 cast the same amount.AI2 is a story about halves and splitting, but also love and coming together- please, see it through until it's whole. I hope and believe you will all fall in love with AI2 like me; AI2 is all I've ever wanted.

I adored the first game and think that was probably my favourite VN of all time, and I'm glad to say I also believe this ones nearly as good. AINI contains really unique puzzles, great locations, amazingly written characters and some really entertaining and fluid action sequences. The presentation and soundtrack are really good and the English voice cast was phenomenal. As a huge Fire Emblem fan, Kozaki Yusuke's spectacular character design was the reason I tried the first game and it has only gotten better for the sequel. I loved the first AI game for how personal and close its story felt. This story definitely goes more grand and ambitious, while I still think AINI was really good, I still enjoyed the first game's story slightly more. Ryuki and Tama are amazing main characters, I did not expect to like them but they were really funny and entertaining. Mizuki and Aiba are of course as fun as ever. Tokiko and the Masked Woman we're two of my favourite new characters, but this entire cast is really fun. The only things holding this game back for me was a lack of interest in the main villain, after AI1's amazing villain, Tearer was a bit of a let down, Uchikoshi's villains have always been some of my favourite characters in his works (999, VLR and AI1's main killers in particular) and I wish we got a cool interrogation scene with them where the mystery came together. I also didn't like the twist revealed at the end of Mizuki Chapter 1 - End Where I Begun. Without getting into major spoilers I feel it invalidates the ending of Mizuki Route in AI1. I also wish it was addressed how the Psync in Mizuki Chapter 4 happens, it felt like a plot hole. These are minor complaints however, and combined are less than 30 minutes of a fantastic 30 hour game. Hats off to Head Writer Kotaro Uchikoshi, Directors Akira Okada and Kazuya Yamada, Lead Artist Kozaki Yusuke, Composer Keisuke Ito, English Producer Alex Flagg and all the ""shy staff who wont give Uchikoshi their Twitter account"" for making another incredibly moving game. Though I prefer the first game's story more, AINI is not far behind and is still by far the better video game with its vastly improved animation quality and somnium puzzles. I can't wait to see what Uchikoshi and his team produce with a potential AI3. This has quickly become one of my favourite series since I played the first game in October 2021 and I implore you to check it out so we can see more from this team because they're so incredibly talented.… Expand",9

The moments that stand out as interesting and memorable are those more grounded and ""science theory"" moments but they are very often interrupted to get more ""anime"" screen time, such as the aforementioned ""action""/""Idol dance + Song"" scenes.The game also creates a lot of plot holes for the 1st game.

Ryuki isOnly doing because Mr. Uchikoshi asked on twitter. While the first entry into the series was average in terms of gameplay, it had very charming character writing. However, the second game has sacrificed character-writing for the sake of superfluous twists that are inconsequential to the player's emotional investment of the game outside any initial surprise they might instill. Ryuki is well-defined, but essentially forgotten about by the third act of the game. This game relies solely on the growth and endearment Mizuki earns in the first game, choosing not to explore her interiority any further in this installment. Another major character is left without any major development for the sake of a twist that also has no real bearing on how the player feels towards these characters or the emotions evoked by the game. The first game may have been rough around the edges, but at least the somnium gameplay segments had the task of figuring out the logic to the character's dream and figuring out how to apply that in changing contexts. It could be considered a genuine puzzle game. This has been done away with and streamlined to the point that the game will essentially tell you what to do in the somnium, even on standard difficulty, and you must simply listen. The prior game had multiple solutions to how a somnium could be completed, but in this game there are no alternatives to the solutions presented by the game, no chance for the player to think on their own. The only somnium that asked for critical thinking on the player's part was what is the ""last"" one the player does. The game is additionally padded with ""QTE action segments"" reminiscent of those seen in Quantic Dream games. The only true improvement in terms of gameplay are the VR segments, which in true point-and-click mystery tradition, allow the player to investigate the scene the for clues and piece together the order of events. If they wanted to make a reading-focused visual novel instead of a point-and-click adventure game, there are many other ways to go about it. With this game's own publisher, Spike Chunsoft, bringing Disco Elysium to Japan this August, it couldn't be a better example of how far behind this game is in terms of gameplay among its peers in the genre. And Disco Elysium was 1/3rd cheaper than this game when it came out.

It of course helped it's one of Kotaro Uchikoshi's works, and I already thoroughly enjoyed his Zero Escape trilogy.I've waited patiently for this sequel and it has not disappointed! Uchikoshi's writing is outstanding, and completely defies logic at all times but his work has so much charm. I found myself enjoying this game even more than I already thought I could. Returning composer Keisuke Ito has improved on his initial outstanding soundtrack accompanying this game too, but still using some of the tracks from the original game so everything feels similar, yet so brand new. Gameplay: The puzzles in this game are just as enjoyable as in the first game. I replayed some of them more than the game expected of me because there's just so much to do, with reaching the main objective but also getting to see the goofy little jokes when you pick the wrong answer.Story: I tried to keep away from spoilers for the longest time, so I could go into this game blind. I'm glad I did, because nothing could have prepared me for this story. It's more insane than in the original, and I expect nothing less of Uchikoshi. From start to finish this was an amazing experience. I laughed, I cried and at several points I was on the edge of my seat. I cannot put into words what this man's work makes me feel, but this game is probably my Game Of The Year. Everyone who worked on it should be insanely proud of themselves for what they've created. If anyone is looking for a completely unique, absolutely insane mess of a game (in the best way!) please consider picking this up.… Expand",10

STORY:I will not talk much about the story itself, but it is perfectly executed. The plottwists are build up perfectly. You always think about which person  is the murder or how and why something happend. It never was easy to simple just guess and be right about your prediction, because you will always got some new Infos thrown into your build up theory which instantly makes it crumble. From beginning to end you will most of the time ask yourself  ""What? I didn't see this coming?"" or ""Could this theory be true?"". The Endingphase also was executed perfectly. I can promise you you will go out of this game with a smile and tears in your eyes.CHARACTERS:All characters regardless of old or new are build with so much care that you really can feel their different personalities. Some characters even got so much nuances to their personality that you can almost feel that they will go through some major changes in future AI: The Somnium Files games. PUZZLES:These were made pretty well some were easy some were a bit difficult. Most of the time I had to use a paper to write down stuff to come to a conclusion. So, don't expect the game to go easy on you. You will have to think and most of the time even outside of the box.CONTROLS:They are precise and work well regardless if in the point-and-click or in the walk around sections. Also the QTE's work fine.  SOUND:If you know the first game you know what you will get. Every song is fitting and compliments the situation pretty well. There even songs in them which get sung by the cast. So there is much you can look forward to.FUN-FACTOR: This is the the part which makes the game so great. Everything regardless of Story, Puzzles, QTE's etc. makes this game so fun. Especially the humor which is always there makes you enjoy this experience so much. I am completely amazed by how well they can handle the serious story bits while still putting in so much humor. They completely mastered this. CONCLUSION:AI: The Somnium Files - nirvanA Initiative is overall  a greatly executed  game. It has great Puzzles, so much humor, a beautifully crafted story and will leave you with the feeling that you want a sequel.So if you never played this game buy the first game and than this one. You will love both from beginning to end!P.S. Give the Nurse more screen time in the sequel!P.P.S. I'm now on my with a receptionist and her to big... ehm.. eyes... yeah EYES... to Atami.… Expand",10

However, unlike other roguelikes, you are able skip the areas that you already completed, so you don't have to go through them again and beat any bosses again.

Despite the areas being randomized, they look and feel like they were designed intentionally and well. I didn't find the soundtrack to be amazing but it's pretty good anyway. The graphical style is charming and looks fantastic. I loved the upgrade system, which allows you to spend gold and upgrade a variety of stats or features that you choose. Every player will have a unique upgrade path. What I didn't like is that you are only allowed to choose from three classes of characters per run, even though there are more than three classes available. You may end up favoring a certain class but it doesn't become available until after another run or two or three. So you have to deal with using a character class that you may not like. Personally, i favored knights, duelists, assassins and boxers. But there are many more. I also thought that the stats system, rune system and other systems could be a bit confusing at times, so it took a while for me to feel comfortable with it. Anyway, I loved the game so much and finished the main game in 37 hours on PC.

What a bummer, especially after spending over 30 hours on the story mode and completing it 100%. The battle/strategy gameplay mode (Destruction), however, I found to be quite enjoyable and addictive. It is not real-time strategy as others have mentioned on here. It is turn-based. All activity on the battlefield stops when it's your character's turn, giving you time to decide your next move. There are over 30 stages and as you progress you will earn ""meta-chips"" which you can spend on upgrades and unlockables to make your team members stronger and better equipped. It takes a while to truly understand all of the elements of battle and there is a LOT of activity on the screen, which can be overwhelming and confusing much of the time, but you'll get used to it.

A pesar de ello disfrute gratamente de la experiencia de 13 sentinels y es un juego recomendable si te gusta el resto de lo que ofrece. Así pues valorare solo el resto de la experiencia.13 sentinels es una mezcla de RTS y Visual Novel, que debe de andar en 20-30%/80-70%, lo cual quiere decir que para quien realmente no es recomendable es para aquellos que no les gustan las visual novels.La historia y la manera en la que es contada es sublime, original y caotica, mostrandonos los eventos de manera desordenada en función de con que personaje vayamos jugando, teniendo que ir ordenándolos en nuestra cabeza (con ayuda del visor de eventos que ya nos los coloca por orden) para ir desenmarañando lo que de verdad ocurre, con una infinidad de giros de guión. La historia nos muestra desde el principio viajes en el tiempo y varios momentos temporales diferentes para terminar de liar la marrana también. La belleza de los gráficos en esta parte es también sublime. Ahora el punto más negativo del juego es el balance entre las dos partes... o mejor dicho, la ""desconexión"" entre ellas. Una vez terminado el tutorial del juego, la parte RTS (la batalla final) y la parte visual novel quedan como dos pegotes separados en el menú del juego. Llegado a ese punto invertí unas 12 horas en solo jugar a la visual novel sin tocar la parte de RTS hasta llegar al punto que no podía continuar porque me obligaba a llegar a una cierta batalla para desbloquear más historia. En esas 12 horas no eche de menos la parte de combate, simplemente porque la historia te atrapa y porque tampoco le ves sentido ponerte a ello: la parte de RTS es la ""batalla final"" y el punto donde confluyen las historias de los 13 personajes, así que hasta ver lo que esta ocurriendo realmente se siente incluso anticlimatica jugarla... este es el punto más  del juego, aunque necesario tal y como se ha estructurado la historia (siendo contada a retales), me hace plantearme si era necesario incluso incluir la parte de RTS en este juego... aunque me imagino que fans del genero estaran en desacuerdo conmigo. igualmente, una gran obra maestra muy recomendable para cualquier fan de disfrutar de una buena historia.… Expand",9

Swimming feels fantastic and adds a lot more exploration, not to mention the scale of this game is massive btw, bigger than Zero Dawn. How you approach the gameplay is also completely up to you - You wanna be a stealthy assassin? ✅ You wanna chug potions like a Witcher and withstand a beating from machines? ✅ You wanna focus melee combat and become a spinning beyblade? ✅ You wanna be a trapmaster and have a more strategic approach? ✅ You wanna sit back and watch your machines cause havoc? ✅ You wanna be a Legolas 2.0 and stack bodies with your bow? ✅ Or become a jack of all trades, master of none. There will always be people that moan saying some assets are recycled from Zero Dawn - but what do you expect? Its a direct sequel! Of course some things will seem similar. If im being honest, it seems a lot harder these days to satisfy peoples needs in games - if its not Apex, COD or Fortnite they just arent interested and are quick to bash a game. I will adjust this review the further I get into it but for anyone contemplating buying this game - do it! so far its incredible.

But back to my point, why is this game hyped to moon and back? What is so special about this empty open world? I finished the game about 5 hours ago and now i have been free roaming around the map for 3 hours and there's hardly anything cool or fun to do. Yes there are robots, but that gets old fast. By the way story is extremely cheesy, like very very cheesy. Last 20 minutes and final boss fight were absolute cringe. I actually regret buying it and i rarely regret buying games, because i always watch videos before and everyone was hyping it up like ""this is gta 5 level game design, this RDR2 level game design"", so i was actually expecting that and it's not even close. Some people are really trying to hate AC Valhalla, like it's some bad game (it's not, it's just not amazing, it's decent), but i would rather play Valhalla right now (even tho i'm tired of Valhalla) than keep roaming around in this game, because it's so boring and story was weak, let's be real here, it was weak writing, very weak even. So my question would be, is this game hyped up because main character is female? Because i'm almost certain, if main character was some dude, this game would get Metascore 77 at best. If that's the case and only thing that changes rating from 6 to 10 is main character's gender, then that's just pathetic. Only thing that should matter is the game itself, not main character's gender. I'm disappointed, maybe it's my own fault that i listened some of these Youtube videos that were praising it as best PS5 game. Next time i wont watch these channels anymore. All in all, seeing how empty and boring this game is, it's even more sad that Days Gone, that is one of the best open world zombie games of all time and actually had interesting world, didn't get a sequel, instead of this.

ALa viciada que me pegué ayer y hoy no es ni medio normal. 15 horas seguidas ( y 4 cargas del dualsense) hacía tiempo que no disfrutaba tanto de un videojuego. Horizon Zero Dawn me enamoró por su historia de ciencia ficción y Horizon Forbidden West me está enamorando por los giros argumentales y lo bonito de su mundo. Le cuesta arrancar pero una vez dentro ya no puedes parar, me encanta. A nivel técnico luce espectacular en todos los sentidos. En estas 15 horas me he encontrado con poquísimos bugs, para que os hagáis una idea una saga que me encanta es Assassin’s creed y en estos últimos la cantidad de bugs es 100 veces mayor (entendiendo la inmensidad de sus mundos abiertos) y aún así la experiencia de juego es totalmente disfrutable y jugable, bueno pues en Horizon Forbidden West la cantidad de Bugs es mínima ¿Cómo lo hace Guerrilla? Seguramente algún caza bugs encuentre los típicos en los que nadas en el suelo, atraviesas el suelo y te caes por debajo del escenario o algún objeto volando (Todos presentes en el 100% de los videojuegos) Aunque yo no me he encontrado más que con un barril volando en estas 10 horas. Está siendo una experiencia muy limpia. Las animaciones faciales son la leche, los animales, las plantas, las rocas, las partículas, el agua, el sonido ambiente. Cierto que el uso de la niebla es excesivo en muchas ocasiones donde apetecería disfrutar más del escenario, imagino que desplegar tanta potencia en cerca, penaliza de lejos, quizás un equilibrio mayor entre calidad de cerca y lejos hubiese sido más aconsejable, aunque menos impactante visualmente hablando de primeras. En cualquier caso me parece increíblemente bonito el mundo construido. Y por último ese DOBLAJE AL ESPAÑOL (España) TOP TOP. Qué maravilla contar con el trabajo de enormes profesionales del doblaje y con la fantástica Michelle Jenner doblando a Aloy. No sé en otros idiomas pero en Castellano el doblaje suma muchísimo a la experiencia final.

Not even an hour into the game, and I'mWhen I first seen the trailer of this game, I thought this was going to be the next-gen AAA biblical gaming experience that I have been waiting for. The developers did a better job at marketing the game than actually developing the game. This game is nothing more than a generic third person open world game. It is just a glorified Ubisoft game. Not even an hour into the game, and I'm already running into bugs. I had a bug where my companion would be swimming in the water in one spot, and he wouldn't follow me. I reloaded my save, only to get another bug where I couldn't examine the remains of the machine. Too many graphical glitches during cutscenes. The facial animations are laughable.  There are many clipping issues in this game. I understand that clipping is an issue with practically any 3D game. Some of the clipping in this game however is inexcusable and could have easily been prevented, had the developers not been so lazy and incompetent. For instance, I jumped and grabbed onto a ladder and Aloy's entire chest clipped through the first step of the ladder when she swinged forward. By the time I finished climbing the ladder, Aloy's ankles clipped through the last step of the ladder. This could have been prevented if the developers simply placed the ladder higher and removed the last bar of the ladder, but the developers were too lazy and careless to do that. The story is garbage. Too many cutscenes, it's basically a movie. The voice acting is poor, especially Aloy's voice acting. She always does an exhausting sigh sound at the end of every sentence, it's annoying. The physics are trash. And don't even get me started with those hair physics. I understand hair physics are likely tough to pull off, but they should have kept it simple rather than complex. Aloy's hair moves around like it's underwater. Speaking of underwater, I ran into a glitch where Aloy was swimming on land.   There is nothing to do in the open world. It is so empty and boring. Just a boring world full of plants, rocks, and water. That is so boring to explore. There is a board minigame you can play called Strike which is basically a rip-off of Chess. Speaking of chess, the characters don't even move the machine pieces in real-time. In the first Watch Dogs game, the characters actually move the chess pieces with their hands. How can a 2014 game actually get that part right than a 2022 game? Unbelievable. If you think this is bad, that is just the tip of the iceberg. Aloy can't even open treasure chests in real-time. I remember playing a Harry Potter game some time in 2002 and Potter actually opens the treasure chest accurately and grabs things inside it. And this was 20 years ago in a PS2 console. That is embarrassing, even moreso when you take into account that movie tie-in games are commonly referred to as lazy cash grabs. That just proves how lazy the developers are, and it continues with their lazy level design. The missions are boring and repetitive. The side quests are even worse. The only good thing in this game is graphics, but the graphics sacrificed the physics and gameplay mechanics. There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the main story, there is not a reason to touch this game again. Charging $60 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. I would have been fine with no multiplayer if this game had so much depth and content like Red Dead Redemption 2, but the developers were too greedy and lazy for that. And the greedy developers had the audacity to charge $70 for this garbage in a pathetic attempt at scamming players to pay an extra $10 for absolutely nothing. Make sure to get the PS4 version to get the PS5 version too for $60. Actually $60 is still too much for this game. I recommend you pick this game up until it is $10 or wait until it is free on PS Plus. This game made me appreciate Ubisoft more. They can release open world games with nearly the same quality and more content at a faster rate. … Expand",0

This can also be fixed via a simple mod for PC.- Font is horrible but can easily be patched on PC. Also, screen tearing issues but NVidia Control Panel can fix that if you own an NVidia card. By far this is the best version of Final Fantasy VI. They delayed this port to add extra polish and it shows. While the other pixel remasters were good, this is near perfection. While there are some very minor issues, a few of the songs don't hit as well as the SNES version, the rest of the OST is fantastic. The visual enhancements they did decide to implement look wonderful but you'll probably wish there were more. All and all it's a very, very faithful remaster that has the quality of life improvements that further make this game's world that much more immersive. Despite the few small issues it does have, it is a great remaster, and if you have a PC I'd highly suggest picking it up because it's the best way to currently play FFVI. If you never played FFVI before, this is your chance and you'll see why it is regarded as one of the best, and many people's personal favorites in the series and one of the best JRPG's of all time.

The acting is top notch, the story is engrossing, and the gameplay is unique. There's a truly impressive amount of content to be discovered. It's a riveting experience unlike almost any other game. Finding a new clip is extremely satisfying and unraveling the mystery will throw you through so many different emotions. This game definitely isn't for the prude or faint of heart, but if you're willing, this is absolutely worth a playthrough. The non-linear storytelling works very well with the mystery format. It truly does feel like you're unwinding a lost piece of history. One of my favorite elements (although admittedly a minor thing and not something that everyone would appreciate) is the use of different cameras and editing techniques within each of the Marissa's films. It really gives each of the movies a unique feel and does a good job of grounding them in the time period in which they were supposedly produced. Overall, I can see why some people might not appreciate this game (specifically if you're prudish/uncomfortable with nudity --although this is DEFINITELY NOT pornography, like some other reviews have suggested). Whether or not you appreciate this game will probably come down to the individual, although I have a feeling that this will be a cult classic for many, many years. This is an incredible experience for film, art, and mystery enthusiasts.… Expand",10

They are also playing hard with FOMO by selling ""rare"" cars as ""limited"" to push the weakest people to use their real cash in their game. And WORST OF ALL, it was already bad enough but two weeks after the game released, they just pushed an update that divided by two almost all rewards for races, this is absolutely disgusting.- The campaign mode is the shortest (by far) and most linear of all games of the license.

It allows players to drive any car on any track that they want (once the tracks in question are unlocked by means of game progression) for casual fun, either in single player or two-player battles. It would also be a necessary option for players if they don't want to grind and just get in their favorite cars.2. It gives players the incentive to test drive a specific car before deciding on buying them from their respective dealerships in the game's career modes. This is even more important considering that two dealerships in the game, the Used and Legendary Car Dealerships, have a rotating line-up of cars that change their availability in real time, meaning it could take long for a car to show up there.3. Rental cars in the Arcade Modes don't go through performance degradation (such as the oil, engine and chassis rigidity). Cons:1. Remember that they are *rental* cars restricted to the Arcade Modes only, where you can borrow them for free. You cannot use them in the main campaign unless you buy, collect and earn them in your Garage.2. Because of them being rental cars, you cannot apply tuning parts, custom liveries and other such customization items. Only car-specific default colors, liveries and variations can be used from the color/livery selection, and that set-up tuning will only be based on the car's default setup, wherever possible. All tire compounds are freely available for use, however.3. As opposed to using cars from your Garage in the Arcade Modes, they should make it where you won't earn credits and Daily Workout progress driving a rental car, in order to keep things balanced.… Expand",4

A 1440p at 60fps for those who want a balanced experience, this is my setting of choice because unless you are 1 meter away from the TV you won't be able to tell a difference from the native 4k mode due to the amazing anti-aliasing naughty dogs have implemented in these games. And an outstanding 120fps mode that is very solid when it comes to frame rate, I was honestly debating whether I should play on this mode since my TV supports hdmi 2.1 but I decided I would play on the 60fps mode for the sharper visuals. No matter what mode you chose all three modes make full use of the ps5's hardware capabilities. 3d audio in this game is amazing, easily the best 3d audio implementation so far. To recap, the addition of a 60 and 120fps mode + 3d audio + dual sense features + faster loading times + slightly improved visuals with less visible pop in  and improved contrast + smaller game size overall, makes this collection worthy of being added to your ps5 game collection. If you are replaying it then you will have an amazing time with all the improvements and its well worth the 10 dollars.

When compared to the remasters of Death Stranding and Ghost of Tsushima this one just feels like its more held back compared to the others. I feel the lack of new features does not justify the additional $10 charge from the PS4 versions of the game and it should have been a free upgrade for PS4 owners of the original. Conclusion-Legacy of Thieves Collection is a solid remaster of two of the best PS4 games ever and while it still feels like they could have added maybe new modes or features to the remaster to justify its price increase I still think it holds up as a worthy remaster.

To make matters worse, the standalone versions of Uncharted 4 and Lost Legacy were delisted from the PS Store, in a pathetic attempt of scamming players to pay $50. If you already own Uncharted 4 or Lost Legacy, it costs $10 to upgrade. This game offers no new content or massive improvements to justify the $10 upgrade. The upgrades are just FPS and resolution boosts that most developers would give away for free. This outrageous greed makes Ubisoft look like saints in comparison. Ubisoft gives away their upgrades for free, while Naughty Dog charges $10 for upgrades of older games. Forget new content, the greedy developers are charging $10 to get less content. They removed the multiplayer and co-op, basically removing half of the game. The developers were too cheap and lazy to keep the multiplayer. Not even EA would be that cheap and lazy to remove multiplayer from their PS5 upgrades. The developers are so lazy, they couldn't even add ray-tracing. The physics are still trash in this game. When I shoot an enemy off a cliff, they still fall off like statues. I was hoping to get physics that look like the E3 demo of Uncharted 4, but the developers were too greedy and lazy for that. Even PS3 games like GTA 5 have better physics than this game. Imagine a PS3 open world game having better physics than a PS5 linear game. That is embarrassing. There is no multiplayer. So once you beat the story, there is not a reason to play this game again. Charging $50 for a game with no replay value is a cash grab. And the greedy developers had the audacity to cut out half of the game and still charge $50. This outrageous greed makes Activision look like saints in comparison. When Activision released Modern Warfare 2 remastered with no multiplayer, they were only asking for $20. Naughty Dog wants $50 for half of the game. Pathetic. I don't recommend you buy this garbage at all, even for the $10 upgrade that should be free. Do not support these greedy practices.

Meaning the mission structure is a mess, the game is built around selling you microtransactions, and the enemy a.i. is still a joke. The good: the environments are unique and light infused enemies are unique. You have fought Guardians in player versus player, but not in the game world. The fights are much more interesting than the usual bullet sponge boss fights. Destiny also continues its excellent run and gun gameplay. Nice to see higher framerates on PS5. The story is as obtuse as ever, for better or worse. The bad: more of the same from an eight year old game. The run and gun game play used to be best in class, but other games have caught up. The game engine looks end of life. Environments and animations have a last gen look and feel. Enemy a.i. is as dumb as ever. You will see enemies chase you and stop when they reach the end of their zone. Enemies continue to run backwards while shooting, shoot at players before the player is visible, and jump backwards onto platforms. The game also remains focused on forcing players to play Bungie's way. Fight waves of enemies while Ghost unlocks a door. Fight waves of enemies to pick up keys to unlock a door. Fight waves of enemies in an enclosed arena while you dodge boss stomps. This DLC could have dropped in 2014. Bungie is stuck in a rut. The really, really bad: Destiny continues to sell all manner of microtransactions. The DLC are a kind of pay to win mechanic. All of the progress from ""The Witch Queen"" is short circuited by the new pirate themed DLC. Just when ""The Witch Queen started dropping gear at 1400 light, the pirate DLC hands out a full set of gear at 1540 light. Also, why is the light level so ridiculously high now? Its just bigger numbers. The gameplay is still the same. Destiny is not only showing pop-ups for DLC, the game forced upon me an advertisement to Bungie's online store and their collection of Destiny themed T-shirts. The conglomeration of DLC makes the game world a cluttered mess. Finding the next mission objective is like a game unto itself. Full disclosure: I stopped playing Destiny after Shadowkeep dropped and only came back because of Bungie's free DLC week for Destiny 2. The reason I left the game is because the hamster wheel had turned so many times that Bungie started reintroducing gear that players had ""earned"" years ago. It felt like Bungie was making me buy things I already owned. Worse, if you wanted to play the ""meta"", be competitive in Crucible, and have the right gear for the raids, you needed to buy DLC. I just cannot in good conscience support a pay-to-win game. But the free week also showed that even with all DLC available, Destiny as a game has been turning its wheels. DLC like ""The Witch Queen"" may be a reason to come back to Destiny, or maybe its a good reason to spend your money elsewhere and stop playing Destiny forever.… Expand",5

D2 completely baffled me when it came out, it felt like everything went backwards. There was so little to do, double primaries (for some reason), fixed rolls, it was total sh*t. I came back after I heard Forsaken was good and got back into destiny, it felt good to enjoy the game again, however, once the game went free to play and became a seasonal type of game, things started to slowly dip off for me again. After experiencing season of the Opulance, I thought the seasons were going to be great, but every season since then just kept getting worse. That brings us to Witch Queen, its best highlight is finally making a good campaign with a legendary mode. That was pretty much it for me to be honest. Void 3.0 felt like it only created more problems in pvp, pve felt the same in every way (strike after strike after raid), no factions or foundry vendors where I can buy certain guns I want, weapon crafting feels like a heavy grind for slightly better weapons. I mainly stuck around for the fun gun mechanics and pvp, but pvp is so stale and broken all the time. No new maps, no new game modes, over shield and invincibility spam constantly, the pace of combat is 100mph all the time.

I never thought I'd be exciting to see the return of lesser known TMNT characters like Wingnut, Groundchuck and Dirtbag, and the Triceratons, but here I am fanboying over all of it! There is one thing that I think holds it back, and it's some parts of the combat. For the most part it's fine and intuitive, but I find it a little tougher to pull off certain attacks that were much easier to pull off in Turtles in Time. It's not a huge problem, but it can be with certain bosses where these moves come more useful. I also feel like they could've had a museum or a gallery mode talking more about the characters and bosses to really flush out the game, but maybe the upcoming Cowabunga Collection will have something like that. Shredder's Revenge is worthy to sit among Turtles in Time and the original Ninja Turtles Arcade as some of the best licensed games and beat 'em ups I've ever played! Dotemu and Tribute Games put a lot of care and effort in bringing back nostalgia in a modern beat 'em up, something they seem to be rather good at. I haven't played Streets of Rage 4, but now I kinda want to after playing this. If you're new to beat 'em ups for TMNT games, this will be one of the best games to start with and I highly recommend it!… Expand",9

1873,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is a call back to a bygone era of games.

Giving you the long-awaited ability to play as MasterTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is a call back to a bygone era of games. This is very much a sequel to TMNT: Turtles in Time, but it also is leaning very, very heavily on nostalgia, pretty much running every single popular character and toy from the original series in the game as a boss or someone you have to rescue. Giving you the long-awaited ability to play as Master Splinter, April O’Neill, and Casey Jones, this game has seven characters instead of four, and while it is a side-scrolling beat ’em up, there are some differences between the characters. Unfortunately, this game also shows why they don’t make these games anymore – this game took a lot of effort to make, and is nicely animated pixel art, but it’s only two and a half hours long. If you try and collect everything, it might take you another hour… but after that, it’s just grinding for some tedious achievements, which isn’t fun. The other problem is that beat ’em up gameplay remains very simplistic, and this game is no exception. The characters aren’t especially mobile, and while it reflects the design of the era, modern games are more fun to play and less awkward and stiff. This isn’t bad as far as beat ’em ups go – in fact, it’s a reasonably good example, though Turtles in Time felt like it had better variety – but the game is still very simple, and not really super fun to play. Being short is a saving grace as much as it is a drawback; if it was any longer, you’d get bored. Which is the biggest problem, really – it isn’t 1994 anymore. Back in the day, I remember enjoying these games, but today, they’re just too simple compared to modern game design. The game is quite easy even on the middle difficulty setting, but cranking the difficulty didn’t really make me any more enamored with it. The high difficulty older beat ’em ups were designed as quarter eaters; modern games don’t benefit from that, but it reveals just how little content there actually is. While it was kind of nostalgic seeing all these characters again, the voice acting wasn’t great and the only thing that made me laugh was the “twist” at the end. All in all, I can’t recommend this trip down memory lane unless you get it for free, like playing it on Game Pass or something. There, it is a reasonable thing, as you can taste it and see if you want to see it through, and even if you do, it won’t feel like it took a bite out of your wallet for such a short and mediocre experience.… Expand",5

I grew up with TMNT and I love the world, characters, style and practically everything about it. I have no history with the old games but I really wanted to give this game a shot. So I got it for the full 25$ it asks after seeing the positive reaction. I played it on Easy difficulty (and later on Normal and Hard) and I loved it. The incredible pixel art, design, references to the show, stages, combat and story presentation. But- I have 3 major complains about the game. The first one is it's length- this is a really short game. Even when I played it on harder settings it only took 2-3 hours. There is online and arcade mode, but both of them consist of you playing the same 16 stages again and again, under different circumstances, or with other people (locally and online). It's still a nice variety of modes, but for 25$ I'd like a bit more. Completing the side quests can also be fun but it never gets much more than that. So I'd wait for a sale, something like 10$ - 15$ is more fitting. Second, is the difficulty. I may be bad, but I feel like Normal mode is way too hard (and I won't even mention Hard mode). I played the game on Easy and it was just like I wanted (and expected)- fun, arcadey game that I can breeze through with couple of retries. But for some weird reason Normal mode is so much harder! And it's not that I'm bad- I created an online party and even with some people we needed to retry some stages multiple times. I know this game is more so designed for 2-4 players, like the old games, but replaying stages creates my biggest critique of the game- playing stages multiple times. It's. BAD. When I play through a stage once or twice I pretty much get the idea of it, and I'll usually reach the boss on my first try. The problem? I'll probably die. And dying makes me play the whole stage again- so I'm doing the exact same thing. I know this sounds weird because games always make you replay levels, but the problem is that once you played the level 2-3 times you know exactly what to do, and it feels useless. Especially when talking about a beat-em-up game, which can get repetitive very quickly without good design. Now don't get me wrong- the design is incredible, but once I do the exact same thing for 4-7 minutes and then die, and I need to do it again- that drives me crazy.Overall, I was busy complaining about TMNT: Shredder's Revenge because there are a ton of reviews praising this game. It's definitely a great game, but I just wanted to give you my honest opinion. Either way, I still think this game is one of the most addicting games I've ever played, and that any other element I didn't negatively mentioned it up to perfection. I give it 8/10, and you should definitely but it if it seems like what you want.(sorry if I had some English mistakes)… Expand",8

Really, I don’t know what else I could’ve asked out of this game in terms of how it looks because this is exactly the kind of presentation we should’ve gotten out of a TMNT game for ages now. My only complaint about the art in this game is everything is a bit smaller than I’d like. This leads to problems which I get into below. Sound: 10/10From the head bopping tracks to the hard hitting sound fxs to the excellent voice acting, the sound department hits its stride on all angles. Im sorta disappointed that we didnt get Pat Farley back as Krang and Baxter Stockman back. Really kinda confuses me as to why, considering he recently reprised his role in the 2012 series. But despite the new voices for all the other minor characters, Im glad that we got the main 4 reprising their roles nonetheless and the new cast still do a phenomenal job. Gameplay: 8/10For a spiritual sequel to the originial arcade beat ‘em up titles, this game does a fantastic job at capturing the bone crushing gameplay, along with adding some new mechanics to the game to make it easier. However, while I do appreciate the new special attacks and items, I do have an issue with how much easier the game suddenly becomes when you’re using them, ESPECIALLY in multiplayer. The sheer fact that you can taunt to refill the meter and constantly spam specials suddenly takes away any and all challenge you can get out of this game, and it does make it difficult to get the urge to play it more than once after a while, even with friends. In addition, adding the ability to play with up to 6 players was something I was extremely excited about, but once I saw how the smaller sprites were even harder to identify at times with the chaotic gameplay with a full party of 6, I realized that this made this a bit more of a hindrance than I’d like. Despite these issues, the gameplay is still pretty fun and enjoyable, but it certainly makes it to where it’s enjoyable at short bursts once you beat the game. Story: 8/10If you’re looking for super deep lore in a game based on the 1987 series… boy, you dont know  this series do you? Still, the story in this game is as action packed yet humorous as you’d except out of that iteration of the franchise. In a way, it almost felt like I was watching an extended episode. Difficulty: 1/5 (Very Easy)Even on the most difficult setting, the gameplay mechanics I mentioned make this an absolute breeze to plow through, especially if you’re playing multiplayer. Playing single player MIGHT give a challenge on the hardest difficulty, but it’s almost mandatory to play a game like this with others. BOTTOM LINE:9/10 Despite the faults this game has in the gameplay department, this game serves the very same purpose the original arcade titles aimed to do: Provide a quick and fun multiplayer session with random people or with friends. I highly HIGHLY suggest getting the switch version just for the sake of being able to bring this game with you on the go and while meeting with friends, busting out this title to play locally. If you never got a chance to experience the joy of the original arcade game and you’re looking for an awesome time, this is your best bet!… Expand",9

And you can smash 'em all to heck.) In the beginning you'll probably just button-smash your way through, but there's a helpful tutorial sequence that pops up when you start, to remind you there are some moves to learn. At minimum, learn to revive downed teammates with pizza, and learn to throw Foot soldiers toward the camera (that move will come in handy in a certain boss battle). One thing that makes this game great is that a group of players of all different skill levels can play together. Even a toddler - if they can hold the thumb stick to move forward, and maybe occasionally press the attack button, they can participate (even if they can't really be useful). With up to 6 players able to join, nobody gets left out. The difficulty level is appropriate, and adjustable.

OneGreat Visuals and Gameplay. Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered on PC is a really nice looking game and Nixxes Software, once again, prove that they know their stuff when it comes to porting games over this platform. The game’s release is not without a few flaws here and there and we’ve already seen a small patch released a couple days ago, with a bigger one coming in the future. One of the most amazing aspects of this game is how well designed and realized New York City is, and how good it feels to swing around everywhere. It’s just not how it feels, but also how well animated Peter’s movements are, the acceleration, speed, momentum, there’s a lot of stuff packed in there to make it feel believable, that we’re actually swinging around NYC for real.Clearly, a ton of development time and work has been put into that major aspect of the game, to make it reach a level where it feels this good…I don’t know how much time and effort it took Insomniac Games but…and incredible job, because it’s great. Characters are pretty well animated and their English voices are very nice too, the game’s story has several moments where their performances really shine, with lots of emotion packed in there for sure. Let’s dive into the actual PC Performance and, as most people who’ve played or heard of the PC port by know, you may be aware that the general consensus is that this is a really CPU demanding game, especially when using Ray Tracing Reflections.Indeed, on my Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti, the game can really push those 12 CPU threads to really high utilization when RT is enabled but there are still some settings and tweaks that we can use to make it run a bit better.With the proper settings, it’s possible to achieve pretty close to stable 60 locked FPS at 1620p DLDSR downsampling, with Quality DLSS, only dropping below 60 here and there when swinging around outdoors; indoors though, it’s usually more stable even though certain interior places can have pretty demanding RT Reflections too. It is uncertain if, at this point, the developers may yet offer any performance enhancing updates in any future patch, those may come…or not, but the game in no shape or form runs badly all things considered…it’s just quite demanding, which is different, and finding a good balance between your CPU and GPU loads in game is crucial, for what you may want to tinker with certain CPU demanding settings, in game resolution to increase GPU load and/or stuff like DLAA which may help putting even more load into your GPU, if you feel it can be utilized a bit more. This is all when using Ray Tracing, because without it, the game can easily run above 100 FPS at 1440p and even 1620p, Max Settings, on my system, still looks fine, but of course RT Reflections add a lot to many areas of the game. Keybinds are quite decent for Mouse and Keyboard usage, and I’ve only found that we’re lacking some shortcut keys for stuff like individual gadgets usage, because most of the other in game actions that are important, like web-shooting, can be mapped to individual keys no problem.Mouse Input has no apparent acceleration or any other issues that I can feel/see, and it works well enough.That said, for this game I played with my DualSense controller, with the added features that only work when Steam Input is disabled, and wired, of course, as usual. It’s a nice experience, even though I felt the adaptive triggers a bit too weak and the sound coming from the speaker to be…pretty much useless (we can hear some sound when shooting our webs, that’s about it I think). Moving on to the aspects of the game I find aren’t as great…well, if I said earlier the world is great looking and nice to traverse around, it also presents big classic open world issues, like lots of repetitive tasks and events, radio towers to hack (although there aren’t that many) and other typical stuff many consider very average open world “filler”. Besides that, I found that I wanted a few more Side Quests, the ones that we got…are mostly great, but the game could’ve used a few extra here and there, to expand the lore and certain secondary characters even further; I really loved the side content we got…but that’s why I would’ve loved to see a bit more. That aside…I can say this game was a lot of fun to play, combat never gets tiring, which helps a lot to alleviate that “open world filler stuff” to do, until 100% completion so, overall, I’d say this game is a solid 8.5/10, maybe even a 9 if we consider that other open world games tend to have inferior gameplay, and the same or even more amount of average open world tasks and filler stuff to do.… Expand",9

1931,"Spiderman: Remastered is one of Sony’s big PS4 era games. It combines Spider-Man’s web-swinging and wall-crawling movement with the Batman Arkham games’ combat systems, where you have a bunch of spider gadgets for combat along with your brawling, and you fight groups of thugs/armed goons/etc. in simplistic but flashy combat. Unfortunately, not only have there been four Batman ArkhamSpiderman: Remastered is one of Sony’s big PS4 era games. It combines Spider-Man’s web-swinging and wall-crawling movement with the Batman Arkham games’ combat systems, where you have a bunch of spider gadgets for combat along with your brawling, and you fight groups of thugs/armed goons/etc. in simplistic but flashy combat. Unfortunately, not only have there been four Batman Arkham games at this point, but the actual core gameplay is surprisingly not great. The problem is that while Spider-Man is fun to control, and Spiderman is better to play as than Batman in terms of fluid movement and mobility, it all ends up highlighting a big problem – the combat system is ultimately pretty shallow, and making Spider-Man even more powerful than Batman makes the combat even more trivial – all the more so after playing four Batman: Arkham games. The game leans very heavily on brawling combat, which was always the worst thing about Batman Arkham style combat, and the enemy variety isn’t great – there’s basically thugs, thugs with weapons, thugs with guns, thugs with shields, big guys, guys with magic swords, guys with magic whips, and flying guys. For a game as long as Spider-Man, that’s not all that many enemy types, and while there are four “gangs” of enemies, they are all pretty similar in a lot of ways, particularly as far as basic goons go. The predator style sections aren’t great because the environments, by and large, aren’t great; the starting sequence is cool, but most of the game is honestly pretty dull environmentally, making the predator sequences not all that interesting. Moreover, because Spider-Man is so powerful, he can actually fight guys with guns in the open, meaning that messing up a predator sequence or simply ignoring it in favor of fighting it out is an option – and it makes these sequences nowhere near as tense as they were in the Arkham games. Add this to the fact that, unlike in the Batman games where the villains were constantly taunting you while their goons were going at you, here it is just normal enemy callouts, which get even more repetitive given how much busywork there is in the game. The net result of all this is that most of the core gameplay of the game wears thin pretty fast. Moving around the city is reasonable enough, but it isn’t enough, and the novelty of Spider-Man’s moveset wears off after not all that long. Added to this is the core problem with the Arkham style combat – difficulty in making good bosses. This game really struggles with it, and several of the boss fights are glorified quick-time events. While there are a few bosses that are more than this, there’s honestly not many bosses at all – only ten, and four of them are basically repeats. And none of them are very good – they all tend to be very simple and repetitive. The result, then, is that the game relies heavily on its story… but it kind of falls down there, too. Playing as Peter Parker, the snarky, wise-cracking Spider-Man, you play in an open world version of New York City, specifically Manhattan. Like 90% of open world games, the open world is just boring distractions – there’s a lot of “stuff” out in the world, but most of it is not that interesting, and is basically padding and does little to nothing to contribute to the story. And yet the game contains vast amounts of this stuff, as if it would be fun to do 20 gang hideouts that are highly similar and only really have like four unique lines of dialogue. Spider-Man giving witty quips is fun; Spider-Man fighting piles and piles of goons over and over again without any interesting verbal interplay is not. The core plot contains nine different villains, but you only spend enough time with two of them to really get much out of them. Unfortunately, even there, their motivations are very shallow, and almost all of the enemies basically boil down to “guy who is angry all the time” in terms of characterization. While they have different gimmicks, they just aren’t that interesting as characters, and given the importance of good villains to superheroes, that’s quite the issue. The Batman Arkham games leaned heavily on the Joker for a reason, but Batman’s rogue’s gallery is just more interesting than Spider-Man’s, and this game, despite being an “original” Spider-Man story, doesn’t actually do anything to make the bad guys particularly interesting. Doctor Octavius is the most interesting of the lot, but he ends up feeling like “Generic revenge-driven mad scientist” almost all the time. It tries to introduce Miles Morales a ways into the game, but he’s kind of bland compared to Spider-Man, lacking his powers and feeling a bit generic in terms of characterization. MJ works better, but the missions where you play as her are not great, as you end up with very restricted movement and there’s not a strong story payoff, though she wasn’t a bad character overall.… Expand",4

О персонажах: 90% из них плоские и скучные, а некоторые (как та очень сильная и очень независимая из Соболя), бесят до скрежета в зубах. Злодеи кажутся интересными только на первый взгляд. Например нам пытаются приподнести Мистера Негатива как неоднозначного персонажа, жертву обстоятельств. И это бы работало, если бы он и его люди не занимались терроризмом и не убивали мирных.

Spider-man is so enthralling it keeps sucking you back in, the game has zero microtransactions, NONE! and that is so uncommon that it made me forget what a full game felt like where I wasnt nickel and dimed for cosmetics. Just buy the effing game!!

I liked him before, and I liked him even more after playing the game. -2 unfortunately the things that you actually do as Spiderman are very limited. You swing around between story missions - later you can fast travel, but since +1 the swinging around is great I don't know why you would - and there is a wide variety of icons that will have you swing around some more to catch things or throw things or fight things for reasons that are well explained, but don't change the fact that you are always doing the same thing. -1 you are doing all the interesting stuff in cutscenes, which means that you actually don't get to do them. If you like to watch TV instead of playing the game this is totally fine, it's just that I hate being pushed into the passenger seat. If I want to watch a movie, I watch a movie; if I want to play a game I want to do stuff. ALL the stuff. I don't want to be Andrew McHolland's stunt double who never gets to do the really cool scenes and instead gets beaten up at lot because -0.5 the controls with keyboard and mouse are great, except when they are not, and they suddenly decide to not respond. It really doesn't happen a lot, but in a game with the Batman-Arkham-Combat, where a single miss will turn you from a wonderfully animated kickboxing machine into a wonderfully animated tumbling mess of broken limbs, it is really aggravating when it happens because the controls have given up on you. -0.5 Too many quick time events boss fights and big action sequences. If you like QTE, disregard this, but to me they are the worst compromise between cutscenes and gameplay, resulting in underwhelming gameplay and a movie that you can't enjoy because there are button prompts in the way. +/- 0 New York looks great, but does not outshine other sandbox cities. It's mostly in your way while you swing from A to B, and a nightmare for those of us who like to complete things. You just cleaned up all the icons and collected all the things in a district? You are just one side mission or progress in the main quest away from it being covered in new icons that want to be collected or fought or both. If you like quantity in your game, this is clearly great. If you like variety... not so much. +/-0 Which always leaves me a little depressed. A whole, wonderfully modelled and presented metropolis with all those great landmarks and it turns into little more than a shooting range, even if you are shooting webs. Some more interactivity would have been greatly appreciated - some more Peter Parker out of costume maybe? This way there is a certain disconnect between one of the greatest places on earth and the stuff that you, the player, are doing. You get to photograph the landmarks on the flyby, but that's it. -0.5 which might be one of the reasons why the actual story didn't do a lot for me. It's not well paced, and it feels drawn out, and the fact that you will spend a lot of time fuffing around does not help with that, which is always the problem with main quests in sandboxes. And while there are lot of game mechanics and progress bars and unlocks, it feels more like a web than something complete, and it really doesn't feed into the story at all. +0.5 which is a lot of nitpicking in an otherwise very polished experience with great production values in one of the better, probably even one of the best PC ports I've seen in a long time.… Expand",8

I think it lacks some Super-Villains, they only appear in the story. Stealth 9/10 - it really surprised me, but the stealth system is really good in this game Story 8/10 - The best part are the villains, they feel like real human beings, also the direction is really good they know how to make a good scene and how to use Spider-Man powers in a really cinematographic way. But I feel that Peter is one of the worst characters, he is so kind that feels unreal, it is so exaggerated. In the end, he even sacrifices aunt May for the sake of saving some hundred unknown persons, and in the whole story, he is just too kind to be true. Also, I've felt the story is kinda short and the game has some secondary missions but most of them aren't anything special (just one main secondary mission with cutscenes) and we won't have many anyways. Open-world - 6/10 - It is the worst part of the game. I know that isn't the focus of the game but I think the open world is too bad. The NPCS are bots that can't interact with you. The activities in the world are just collecting some items, listen to the Radio with JJJ always blaming Spider-Man for everything (in the beginning is cool but after 20 hours it gets too repetitive), and some boring mini-games, the best part are taskmaster missions. But IMO, the open world is really outdated, it lacks more interaction with NPCs and some random missions and encounters. The game has some assaults, robberies and aleatory events but they are too simple and repetitive, it would be cool if it had some story, at least in two or three of them. Graphics 7/10 - for me it is ok.

On the ""Spectacular"" difficulty level, the game is really not difficult, the boss fights are stylish but the difficulty is almost non-existent. Maybe in New Game+ and/or max difficulty, but I doubt that apart from adding damage and HP to the enemies, it doesn't change much.

This is very much a sequel to TMNT: Turtles in Time, but it also is leaning very, very heavily on nostalgia, pretty much running every single popular character and toy from the original series in the game as a boss or someone you have to rescue. Giving you the long-awaited ability to play as Master Splinter, April O’Neill, and Casey Jones, this game has seven characters instead of four, and while it is a side-scrolling beat ’em up, there are some differences between the characters. Unfortunately, this game also shows why they don’t make these games anymore – this game took a lot of effort to make, and is nicely animated pixel art, but it’s only two and a half hours long. If you try and collect everything, it might take you another hour… but after that, it’s just grinding for some tedious achievements, which isn’t fun. The other problem is that beat ’em up gameplay remains very simplistic, and this game is no exception. The characters aren’t especially mobile, and while it reflects the design of the era, modern games are more fun to play and less awkward and stiff. This isn’t bad as far as beat ’em ups go – in fact, it’s a reasonably good example, though Turtles in Time felt like it had better variety – but the game is still very simple, and not really super fun to play. Being short is a saving grace as much as it is a drawback; if it was any longer, you’d get bored. Which is the biggest problem, really – it isn’t 1994 anymore. Back in the day, I remember enjoying these games, but today, they’re just too simple compared to modern game design. The game is quite easy even on the middle difficulty setting, but cranking the difficulty didn’t really make me any more enamored with it. The high difficulty older beat ’em ups were designed as quarter eaters; modern games don’t benefit from that, but it reveals just how little content there actually is. While it was kind of nostalgic seeing all these characters again, the voice acting wasn’t great and the only thing that made me laugh was the “twist” at the end. All in all, I can’t recommend this trip down memory lane unless you get it for free, like playing it on Game Pass or something. There, it is a reasonable thing, as you can taste it and see if you want to see it through, and even if you do, it won’t feel like it took a bite out of your wallet for such a short and mediocre experience.… Expand",5

And something seems a little off about the hit detection/responsiveness... some hits just don't quite connect when I feel they should've.The voices are generally good, but the recording sounds very dry, like they could've used some reverb or processing so it doesn't sound so much like someone talking into a mic. On the flip side, the artwork is beautiful, if a bit over-pixellated. The enemy nuances are great, such as the little things they get up to when you're not fighting them. Apart from the reworked theme song, the music is excellent, with a repertoire of orchestra hits, synth brass, and other instruments straight from the era of these arcade games. You can tell a lot a care was taken to mimic the style, art and music of these games. But when I'm playing, it feels too often like mindless button-mashing. Yes, that's basically what they were back in the day, but compared to Streets of Rage 4, it's just missing something to keep me engaged longer (the moves/combos are less intuitive? Too many enemies at once for its own good? Missing the crunch of some solid SFX?).… Expand",5

Bayo 3 is an excellent entry in an excellent series and the gameplay has never felt better. Platinum has mastered the Bayonetta formula.

2084,"It's full-on Bayonetta action, but much BIGGER and BADDER, a masterpiece! Well, it took FOREVER for Nintendo and Platinum to release Bayonetta 3 and I'm only too glad it's finally here. I absolutely love the Bayonetta series so I replayed Bayonetta 1 and 2 back to back in readiness for this. Was Bayonetta 3 worth the wait? You bet! While I'm relatively early in the game, I can assureIt's full-on Bayonetta action, but much BIGGER and BADDER, a masterpiece! Well, it took FOREVER for Nintendo and Platinum to release Bayonetta 3 and I'm only too glad it's finally here. I absolutely love the Bayonetta series so I replayed Bayonetta 1 and 2 back to back in readiness for this. Was Bayonetta 3 worth the wait? You bet! While I'm relatively early in the game, I can assure Bayonetta fans that Bayonetta 3 introduces new mechanics like the monster-controlling Demon Slave move very early on, so there's no time to feel as if this is just a same old Bayonetta game. When I first activated Demon Slave, it brought back the same feeling as when Mario first took over the T-Rex in Super Mario Odyssey. There's a certain ""weight"" to the monsters you control in Demon Slave, and it feels good. Because of the much larger scale of monsters you control, some fights are really between giants - a bit like King Kong vs Godzilla. This makes Bayonetta 3 the most epic in terms of scale of some battles. If you're new to Bayonetta, you're in for a treat. Bayonetta is an action game. An over-the-top action game. The signature of Bayonetta games is the crazy, over the top, non-stop bombastic action sequences and combos you can do. In this 3rd outing all the crazy over the top action moves remain, and certain levels have some exploration to be done, but some other things are different. For example, you upgrade your abilities in a slightly more ""RPG"" way and the enemies seem more agile and fluid than their rather rocky and hard predecessors. In some way, it makes them just slightly more challenging than the early baddies from the early games. But with the ability to change difficulties anytime, you can change it to whatever suits you best. Of course, the original voice of Bayonetta has changed hands from Hellena Taylor to Jennifer Hale. I prefer Hellena's voice due to stronger inflexions but I think I'll get used to Jennifer's eventually. As for the story (no spoilers here), right at the very beginning of the story, I thought, no way they're doing this to Bayonetta but I'll leave you to discover the story! All in all, I can say it's certainly worth the wait for the Umbran Witch's return. Bayonetta is just brilliant as ever. Love it.… Expand",10

What this ultimately produces is an ending that will satisfy some, confused others, and leave people either happy or disappointed with Bayonetta 3's ultimate conclusion.

The Nintendo Switch needed a good, new Monster Hunter game, and MH World wasn’t going happen over there because, frankly,Good PC version for a really good MH game. Ever since Capcom started using the new modern RE Engine, with RE VII, we knew it was a very versatile engine with lots of potential and scalability, and the games that came after quite proved that point, on all systems. The Nintendo Switch needed a good, new Monster Hunter game, and MH World wasn’t going happen over there because, frankly, World still looks amazing today, especially at max settings and high resolutions, on PC, and it’s quite demanding too. With MH Rise, that’s what Capcom did, a bespoke Nintendo Switch game, that plays very well, but looks substantially lower quality compared to World, yet plays amazingly well, the animations are quite good and monsters look greater than ever, especially in the way they move and animate. On PC, MH Rise gets some visual upgrades in the form of better quality textures, mainly, but overall the geometrical quality of most assets remains quite similar to the Switch version, but being able to increase the resolution and frame-rates is a big bonus too. On the Performance side of things, the game is quite easier on the hardware compared to MH World, and it is able to run at stable 60 FPS, 4K resolution, on my Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti, and pretty close to 120 FPS at 1620p DLDSR, everything maxed of course.Being a port from a Switch game, another advantage is that the game is able to perform quite well on 4 core CPUs, like my secondary system which has an i5 4690K and a GTX 1070, and on this PC the game is able to run at 60 FPS and more even at 1440p, so I believe a lot of players will be able to enjoy good and smooth performance in this game. One bug/issue in this game, still not fixed as of the posting of this review, is the Resolution Scale (known as Image Quality in the options): 100% Scale is actually doing 75% internal resolution, which I confirmed by manually counting the pixels on screen with basic geometry / math; and then 150% Scale is actually 112.5% over native resolution, so there’s no easy way to do native resolution, but I reckon for now that the closest way is just setting the scale to 150%, and the game will be slightly downsampled. Controls and Keybinds are excellent on Keyboard and Mouse, for the most part, I believe the mouse still has this really, really tiny deadzone, but it feels better than in the Demo, for sure, so I have no major issues with it.There’s one single key I’ve found I cannot map, which is ALT, but it’s no big deal for me, I have plenty more keys to map, and a simple macro or remap via software can fix that issue, too.I am also a left handed player, and I can map the whole right side of the keyboard with no issues, arrow keys included, which is excellent. Now that I have spent more than 70 hours on Rise, I can say I enjoy its more fast paced combat, movement mechanics and overall feel, compared to World; the latter is still an excellent game, with lots of content, but Rise feels so good with the new improvements to movement and fluid animations, and high frame-rates, that it’s truly a joy to play on PC. I have high hopes for the next big entry in the franchise, if they use the best parts of Rise, RE Engine, better movement mechanics, a bit more fast paced than World, but with the amazing graphics of World, only even better, can’t wait for what comes next, and for the Sunbreak expansion this summer, for sure. I am not a veteran on the series at all, but I feel that with both World and Rise on PC, we have a good base to please most types of MH fans, and a lot to expect for future titles and content, which is great. Monster Hunter Rise is a very enjoyable and fun game, one that proves you don’t need the absolute best Graphics in the industry to have a solid experience; the game is just really well done, and getting into a hunt is so straightforward and fast here on PC that it’s just a fantastic experience, as it should be.… Expand",9

It's relentlessly silly, but in a predictable way that an AI could generate if it was fed the previous 2 games. Everyone says pretty much exactly what you expect them to all of the time. The games graphics are amazing, despite what you may hear. The vector images and textured art allow your brain to activate your imagination to interpret a scene, which is an element of pixel art that HD renderings often miss. The game feels more ""alive"", as a result, than other HD games. The inference is terrible, however, and feels made for touch screens. It's context sensitivity ruins a lot of the exploration from previous games and feels hollow. Where the previous game allowed the PLAYER to take actions, and then the game generated pithy outputs, the new game literally puts a prompt to ""comment on x"" on the screen that is literally a quip generating button. It's less fun and takes power away from the player. But the real reason the game is below ""fun"" is that the puzzles are tedious, boring and obtuse. For instance, one puzzle has to feeding an NPC who complains of his food being bland. The solution to the puzzle is to apply fire to it. Like... what? There is an in-game hint guide, so it's impossible to be stuck and have it not be by choice, but once you look up a solution and find that the answer is absurd, it ruins the game. You no longer want to put up with any frustration because the answer might be stupid and you would never figure it out. In the end... this game is just unfun.

Thematically, it's a more thoughtful sequel than games 3-5; it really ties Guybrush's story together. While I realise that retreading the past is kind of the point, the fact that a big part of the game is set on a carbon copy of Melee Island was perhaps more pleasing to a returning creator than to the rest of us (we already got a graphically retouched version of Melee in the special edition). Also, I'd argue that the number of old characters repurposed to fill new shoes felt gratuitous already by the fourth game. Even though the game is self-aware about it, the nostalgia-angle has already been thoroughly milked in previous titles. Be that is it may, the actual adventure is as well crafted as ever and the dialogue is excellent (as you'd expect). Gameplay-wise though, it's a bit of a dissappointment. This is an adventure game that doesn't trust you to play it. By severly limiting the number of actions you may (attempt to) perform, a lot of the lateral thinking involved in solving the puzzles is gone, and the world just doesn't feel interactive any more. Even if most attempted actions don't do anything in classic point and click adventure games, there's value in the feeling of it potentially doing something. I'm not saying that the old 12-verb system would have been the better choice here, but rather that a game like Curse of Monkey Island struck a much better balance in terms of complexity, and this new system holds your hand too anxiously. The puzzles themselves are mostly well crafted. While the new simplified gameplay makes the game too easy (and I played on hard, mind you), you can still get stuck on simple puzzles that are just counter intuitive. A puzzle where you need to simply re-enter a room, took me way too long to figure out, because it doesn't make sense. Similarly, I was stuck forever on another puzzle because it seems I disagree with the developers about the meaning of 'left' and 'right' in terms of rotating motions. No adventure game experience is free from a few hickups like these, though, and your mileage may vary. Speaking of Curse of Monkey Island: compared to that game from 1997, the production values in terms of the graphics are underwhelming. I rarely complain about graphics in games, but I feel Return to Monkey Island really does have a problem in this department. The art style is so avant-garde that it forgets to be graphics, i.e. it's not immersive. The design of the characters' faces feel too abstract and lifeless to allow facial expressions to aid the comedic writing. It's a far cry from the sublime character animations of Curse of Monkey Island (again, from 1997!). Some have pointed out that the wobbly, elastic quality to the animations make it feel like a 'cheap flash game', and well... they have a point. Every instalment since Curse has been underwhelming in terms of character design, animation and atmoshpere, adding to the persisting feeling that we still haven't seen a proper Monkey Island game since the first three.… Expand",6

Much worse than I thought, since I was confident Gilbert's writing would have been top notch despite the art direction. I was wrong.The artstyle is adequate for what the game writing and story are. And I don't mean it in a nice way.Yeah, it's an absolute disaster visually, ugly with cheap flashlike skeletal animations everywhere. It's small, both in scope and in lenght - it has no breadth. It's empty. Just compare the islands in act IV with the islands in Monkey Island 2. There is no Caribbean to be found here. The puzzles are easy and not particularly well designed or interesting, some of them also have small hints on how to solve them (like seeing a blowfish while going down the anchor). They're just silly. The interface... well, I hate those barebone interfaces designed for tablets and little kids at their first P&C experience.And the writing. Oh my god.I said the art style is adequate... because it's a full fledged low tier nickelodeon cartoon. It's silly through and through. Forget On Stranger Tides. It's not a pirate story anymore, it's a cartoon. LeChuck - from a scary ghost pirate - became a caricature, Elaine is utterly destroyed, as is everyone else. Cartoon caricatures.And the writing. I don't even know where to start. Pretentious overall. I'm convinced that in 30 years Ron got sick of people asking him about Monkey Island (and a secret that never existed) and started to resent his creature. Now it's a meta story on growing old and the likes. I don't even feel bad about the ending like most people (I LOVED MI2 ending), but... AGAIN? Not that I was expecting anything different due to all the clues during the game.And where the hell their fixation for THE SECRET came out? They make it sounds like they didn't search for anything else since the beginning of the saga, while it was NEVER a thing.And why Chuckie and Guybrush aren't the ones playing, since MI2 was Guybrush's story? ""Uh, no, it weren't them"" yes, they were, clearly. We also saw his parents in the dream, and they were not strangers. They retconned A LOT and it sucks. Ron was hell-bent on NOT giving the fans what they wanted.Gilbert had no idea what to do with this game, scratched everything he planned and thought (his famous 17 points and ""Guybrush goes to hell and Stan is there"") and destroyed his creature.The music is also disappointing. I mean, it's good but... it's the bare minimum. They just basically gave an orchestration to the old tunes. And it's overdone and overcomplicated, in 1 year no one will remember those tunes, while we still perfectly remember every song in MI1 30 years later.A mention for Dominic Amato, who does an excellent job - still not my Guybrush voice and still doesn't sound like MI1-MI2 Guybrush should sound (too -again- cartoony), but he's GOOD at his job and he was obviously very committed to the part.… Expand",0

The graphics are different thanFirst of all, the game is best enjoyed if you have played all the previous installments, especially the first 2. There are so many references and other stuff which you will not get if you start from this installment. The game itself is really solid and has its place among the other installments as pretty much everything you would expect from a MI game. The graphics are different than before, and yet nothing you can't get used to, and MI already has a history of changing the graphic style in every game, so no points lost there and I don't understand the people who hate on that. It's a shame that acts 1-3 aren't as good as acts 4 and 5 and are pretty much linear. For me, act 4 shines like the good old days and if the previous ones were made more in that manner then this would be a 10/10 easily. As it stands like this, Thimbleweed Park is really a better experience. One more complaint I have about the game is the omission of the classic inventory behaviour. Come on guys, we love the 'I'm not picking that up' and 'I don't think he'd like that', it's better than just getting a red forbidden symbol telling us what we can and cannot do. All the other mechanisms are welcome additions to me, I don't mind the addition of a to do list, and the trivia cards are fun, albeit the questions are very hard, I got like only 20% of them in my playthrough.

Shadows are terribly bad, shading is atroceous, resources poping is constant, frame drops constently and everything is so badly aliased i cannot believe this game was developed specificaly on the Switch. Some text lines are fully voiced, some only have the first couple words voiced, some have just a couple keywords voice, and some lines have different text vs. what the voice actors says! Then there's that thing where Team Jumps doesn't show where you can land and you have to eye-ball it and commit to it as it's active time based now, in a turn base that an annoyance. But there's those blowing statues that are also active time based, which mean you can get blown away while trying to think what your next action will be. The bob-ombs will explode if you don't throw them fast enough. Some monsters do area-of-effect damage when they die, you can just kill them by dashing and run to avoid it. Then some encounters have so much jump pad that some ""Reach area"" encounters can be done without even firing at the enemies in a single turn. The whirlpool in the sand, why not explain how to interact with them? The secret-zones, why remove them from the map if we need to go there a second time after completion? Why preventing me from replaying the final boss??? The scripts are bad. Anything trying to be half epic is so cringy it's actualy embarassing. The riddles seems to have been written by a 12years old. Most characters catch phrase makes them despicable... Sometimes, the white dots that are supposed to turn into a prompt to activate, a door, a ladder, whatever, will not appear. Meaning if you were doing a secret-zone time trial, or even trying to do a coin challenge, you can just try again. Tough luck. In some cinematics, the caracters will just zoom into place. Sometimes they will just pop out of nowhere, but some time they literrally are positioned very very far from the camera and just get dragged into place. I found a couple places where Mario will just stop in it's course, as if there was an obstacle. But no, it's just that some tiles are a couple pixels over the others actualy fracturing the plane on which the characters progress. If you restart a secret-zone time trial, only the main caracter will populate at the right place, the others will be where you left them, and they'll just teleport back into place when you move. Before a combat, you can dash in an enemy, or get dashed by the enemy... It serves absolutly no purpose. When you jump off a cliff, or take a ladder, there's a moment when you can't use Beep-o for no apparent reason. When you find a memory the character stalls there a moment, as if it's reading. Instead of wasting time on those annoying and useless details, Ubisoft could as well have polished the game... Compared to the first installment the planets are less linear, but does not look as good, and now the battles interupt the trip.Luigi's react ability have a black bar in the middle of the screen, covering the energy aura.

It takes way too long to go from one stage to the next. The prequel didn't waste anytime. Puzzles should be optional. If I can skip a puzzle I always do. I rarely skipped a puzzle in the prequel. 3. No weapon specialties like honey, push, ink, etc. I'm mostly done with the second world and I have yet to see any. Maybe I am wrong. 4. Annoying voiceovers. I had to turn them off. This is rare for me. Very rare. 5. The sparks can be handy but I would prefer the secondary attack in the prequel. You shouldn't have to make the decision to use either a spark or activate Healing (rabbid peach), etc. I also find that most of the sparks are not as helpful as they could be.6. Special activations only last one enemy turn! If you activated a defensive spark, or Counter Blow (rabbid Mario), Hero sight (Mario), and the enemy doesn't hit you, or not in the line of sight for Hero Sight, on their turn, it will not carry over to the next turn! You lose it! I could be wrong, but in the prequel if the special attack wasn't used it will remain active until it is used. 7. There is no benefit to prevent your characters from dying. No rating on how well you performed. No incentive to do better. Minor Critiques8. The menus could have been designed better. It takes longer than it should to adjust to them. 9. The rabbids act too serious. They are not crazy anymore. It is strange to see. If this was a standalone game I would have given it anywhere from 5-7. The battles are still very fun. However, the prequel was a MASTERPIECE and when you compare to the prequel, it is pretty bad. Too much emphasis is on the puzzles and open world and that's not what Mario rabbids is all about.

I will say that if you're coming here for any kind of story then you'll be sorely disappointed. But I don't think people play any kind of Mario game for the story so that's a moot point. My biggest complaint is the Switch hardware itself, once again. While docked the loading times are atrocious, especially when I'm just trying to use my skill points and switch sparks around. I suffered major frame drops during the open world, sometimes with it dipping into single digits. Also the voice acting, or lack thereof, really threw me off, with only the two main robot characters being fully voiced and other characters literally only saying a word or two of their dialogue bubble.

The overworld sections have been totally overhauled, and feature must larger and more open environments than the first game had, with more compelling puzzles and extra content.  The cost of this is that the art style of this title is far more simplistic than the first, and is less detailed, though the game does still look very good taken on it's own. The battles are just as fun as they were in the first game, and feature more complexity and flexibility thanks to the new character additions and spark system. The music and sound design are incredible, with two amazing new composers joining Grant Kirkhope to score the game's different levels and environments.  The soundtrack is almost all outstanding, and feels cohesive while still retaining each composter's signature stylings. The game isn't perfect, and does contain a few more glitches and technical issues than I'd have hoped for, one of which resulted in a crash.  With that being addressed, it's still a worthy title and well worth checking out for those looking for a unique and highly enjoyable game, especially to those who played the first entry in this series.

The new settlement towers and barricades? Pure cancer. The towers in particular areI have been a fan of Total War games since Shogun 1 and have particularly enjoyed Total Warhammer 1 & 2. Unfortunately, this is just really, really disappointing. I'm not quite sure what they were thinking with the changes they made because almost all the changes are for the worse compared to WH2. The new settlement towers and barricades? Pure cancer. The towers in particular are utterly unbalanced and make every battle a slog. I say every battle rather than just ""siege battles"" because the AI absolutely refuse to fight you on the open field unless they outnumber you hugely. I've had three open field battles in 6 hours of play. Big, fun set-piece battles are meant to be the centrepiece of this game and this one fails at it's most fundamental level. The new mechanic where rifts into chaos randomly appear in your territories every turn? One of the most annoying mechanics they could have devised. Not only is there no way to prevent this but they take your provinces from 0 to 100 corruption in three turns, discourge enemy agents into your lands and often enemy armies. This means that the only viable tactic is to turtle and spam end turn since, if you expand, you cannot protect your provinces properly. The game economy is broken. This makes having more than one army nearly impossible (especially due to the necessary turtling) and good luck saving enough money to get decent settlements unless you farm Slaanesh's rewards. Does it have good AI? LOLNO, all AI factions at war will make a beeline for the player no matter how stupid it is to do so. This has always been an issue but it's so much worse in WH3. The AI also outright and blatantly cheats in respect of the main quest (you can watch it do so in front of your eyes) but, even worse, if they collect all the souls before you that is an instant game over and there is no option to buy more time by defeating them in battle. The UI? Far inferior to the WH2 one. Optimisation? It runs like a legless paraplegic on a floor made of needles. Look forward to constant graphical glitches and stuttering. Bugs? Quite a few game breaking ones but you'll only find out after having wasted several hours on a campaign. I am going to have to ditch the game until the big combined map comes out or until there is mod support to get rid of the many, many issues because the gameplay is actively anti-fun at present and that is coming from someone who actually quite liked the Vortex campaign in WH2 (which a lot of people complained about). Very sadly, this is the first TW game that I simply cannot recommend. Hopefully they'll fix some of this in patches but I suspect that much of it is unfixable because it represents inexplicable design decisions which would need to be redesigned from the ground up. Regardless, I'll keep an open mind and I hope that I can change this review to a positive at a later date.… Expand",3

If one member of a  unit gets caught on something/someone the rest of the unit can't advance or take orders and continually goes back for the lost unit. I was stoked when I found out that multiplayer can have up to 8 people and the turns are simultaneous, but every multiplayer game I've played has inevitably crashed right after large battles. Now add the fact that the RoC campaign is generally not very fun and contains a lot of unrewarding busywork and even the 8-player multi-campaign isn't that appealing. Sieges are now worse than ever. All they had to do was add Three Kingdoms style sieges, instead WH3 has an RTS tower defence game on top of labyrinthian settlement maps- did I mention that the pathing is now horrible? Yeah, the end result of the changes to WH sieges is that now they take longer, are more tedious and more clumpy. You're expected to keep an eye on resources that you (as the defender) generate and also building towers and barricades *in real time,* which apparently only takes about 60 seconds per construction. Where are we getting these resources from? We're *under siege*. Why wait until the enemy is attacking to put up your defenses? Everything about it makes it the least TW thing Ca has ever done, more micromanagement with significantly less immersion. It's a shameful display. There's plenty of improvements, too: Quality of life stuff like being able to save hero builds, use quickdeal diplomacy and set a budget for your towns to automanage themselves. (Although the RoC campaign has so many BS hoops to jump through my budget has generally been strained in every game, so haven't had a chance to use this budget feature.) Also just the factions themselves; lots of cool models, aesthetics, voice acting, all good stuff. It's just completely outweighed by all the bad stuff. Been playing TW for 20 years and this is the first one to bore me out of playing it within the first couple days. Also it's filled to the brim with bugs. And Immortal Empires will likely be fun, even though it's been a month and that's still not out yet. Just been a few patches that fixed stuff and tweaked/balanced *nothing.* TLDR: Bad campaign, bad sieges and bad story. Cool content though?… Expand",2

WALLED seige battles however are not. If you play online against another player then Walled maps might be tolerable but even still design wise they have a few flaws. When you add in CA's famously bad AI then you have a recipe for disaster. The AI for walled maps are hilariously bad and remind me of Rome 2. Yeah that bad. Don't get me wrong the AI seems to work everywhere else it just turns -1000 IQ for these battles. The other are bugs. Yes yes What's a Total War launch without it's share of bugs. However I believe the big onesshould be ironed out within a month. So if buggy launchs scare you away just keep your ear to the ground and buy it once it's clean. It's still playable now and I have yet to come across major game breaking bugs that other people have said existed but your milage may vary. The minor gripes are that the human/ordertide factions feel a bit undercooked mechanics wise. Kislev feels meh and Cathey is the better of the two but doesn't feel complete or unique from eachother. The ""secret"" unlockables of *spoiler* are a HUUUUGE let down. If you know you know.But everything else ****ing rocks. The Chaos factions are badass. Khorn, Nurgle, Slannesh, and he who I can't spell right all look and feel right. Nurgle mechanically wise feels the weirdest slowest but it fits him well even if it can be annoying. Khorn is straightforward but fun as hell. Slannesh is probably the most meh of the 4 but works well and is likely the faction for people who prefer the campaign map side than the actual battles. **** **** it he is the funnest and funniest with his changer of ways mechanic. The maps for campaign and battles LOOK and SOUND amazing. 11/10 for presentation easily. Battles are more fun than ever and the new units themselves for all factions look amazing.

TheWarhammer 3 is more of the same game as the others. Only worse. It's a very pretty game (well, except for any units when you zoom out), but there is absolutely nothing of substance under the surface. Somehow, CA manage to make the AI worse with every iteration. The only way they can add any level of difficulty is by making the AI cheat and break the mechanics of the game. The economy in this game is broken with very little income generators unless you play the trade caravan faction (which is bonkers money). The only viable expansion strategy is to beeline for the nearest income settlements (usually gold resource etc) and these still don't give as much income as previous warhammer games. Because of the economy and being punished for having multiple armies, you will struggle to build more than 1 army in the early to mid game. The limited army count and being tied to a commander is bothersome when your 1 army will be playing whack-a-mole trying to deal with randomly spawning armies and chasing (but failing to ever catch) AI armies running around the map on forced march. It's particularly galling when forced marched armies just run right past your army into your territory to sack towns, and your army still cant catch them! Playing as Kislev, with a selection of hybrid ranged units, the AI defending a town will normally let you expand all your ammunition to butter them up, while they run around in circles and take the beating. Most of the battles will be as easy as this until CA give you a quest battle which is an ambush mission, so the enemy completely surrounds you and the fighting starts instantly. You don't even have time to figure out what is going on this case, and your army will be dead in 1 minute. Units in battles are strangely unresponsive in oombat. Often they seem to forget what they are doing in a fight or not react to getting attacked on one side... and just sit there doing nothing. I thought it was guard mode at first but I confirmed this was turned off. Every 'unique' mechanic is just a different name for battle generated points which are used to get more stats. The whole game is spreadsheeting with few tactics or actual mechanics. All 'gameplay additions' are usually just another tracker page for you to monitor as the game progresses and 'interact with' to get more stats. Missile units overlapping apparently block eachother from firing, despite there not actually being any true missiles in the game. Magic is the same system of you just spam spells repeatedly for very little real effect, besides a few select spells. Battles aren't fun. There is no challenge beside when the AI cheats and breaks the game. Campaign map is more irritating than anything else. The creators of this game don't even play the game, that should tell you everything you need to know right there.… Expand",0

Even low end items are still somewhat relevant late game since you can fuse with other itemsI'm sorry to say this game desperately needed another 6-12 months of work before publishing. It has some nice little positive changes so it's not all bad so let's start with those. Exp gained on lords is is actually based on the enemies so you are no longer encouraged to battle each army twice. Even low end items are still somewhat relevant late game since you can fuse with other items to make them higher tier ones(lots of useless and worse items available in higher tiers tho that needs balancing).Diplomacy has nifty quick deal feature to allow player much faster gauge on what kind of deals they can do and you can now technically trade settlements with AI.In battles AI now feels more human(both good and bad at same time but we'll get to this later) and it tries to dodge spells. And well, that's all she wrote. Really, those were the only positives I could find so let's move to the dark side. On the negative side sadly this game shines like a beacon in the dark. The game pace is atrociously slow compared to WH2. Even minor settlements have sieges now. These sieges are extremely dumbed down so that you can never lose them, but you will take huge losses over nothing if you don't do them manually. This means you will take tons of extra time either manually playing those or you Auto-Resolve them and take time healing/building up again while enemy bolsters their troops making those battles take again more time.As defender in sieges you are now allowed to build towers and barricades middle of the battle and keep rebuilding them constantly. As defender you can beat giant armies that should walk over you at ease by selecting supply point and turtle there. The AI has huge problems with pathing in sieges and tends to just let you kill them in bottle necks. Your towers will lay waste to everything(including your own army if you buy tier 4 towers). You cannot control the towers to focus fire which is yet another thing that felt like it was dumbed down. I actually liked the idea of getting freedom to build towers and barricades to siege, but it should have been left as something you do when placing your troops at start instead of mid battle. For first battle or two this felt great fun new-ish thing. Sadly after couple battles you realize this is what you are going to be facing 70-80% of your battles.As attacker on sieges you will realize just how awful the AI can be. You can leave single scout visible opposite side of siege and hide your army into obvious forest to abuse the crap out of the dumb AI. AI will respond as you'd expect. It will move all their troops to that scout side and waste all their points there while your army can march from behind with streets empty. Alternatively you can do it the other way around also. show your army and backdoor points with quick units. The enemy will send proportionally huge chunks of their army to deal with the scary intruders making rest easy pickings. The AI loves spending their points on worthless tier 1 junk towers btw, it just buys the cheapest crap as it has no idea how to play the sieges.siege maps also have ramparts locations similar to standing on old walls(except these ramparts can be walked to even by cavalry). The AI does not understand those at all. It might have their elite swords just standing there while you keep backstabbing or shooting them there like idiots. Again it's a fun idea, but terrible execution.Regarding sieges I truly hope when Mortal Empires comes they give us ""classic"" option for sieges just to bypass them or at least make it so these are thing only for major settlements with walls for example. You gotta fix pathing, AI, tower spam, turtling and make the AI understand battles it can take. You can just farm AI for free money and items when it keeps bashing their heads into a wall over and over again while you don't even need army anymore. These sieges made took away a lot of economy management and map control since you no longer need to keep armies there. Sieges also begin instant attrition which makes them even easier for you while keeps taking the fights even dumbest players will win if they turtle. On the world map the AI is back to the dark ages of first WH. It plays extremely passive. You are stuck hiding in ambush mode to not make it run. It's constant cat and mouse if you don't.You are no longer encouraged to keep expanding. Rather again turtle tactics are just as good if not better with the new campaign. It's like devs looked what was bad with Vortex campaign and decided to go deeper into it. Unlike Vortex this objective is not optional way to play.

The “corruption” they cause is just as bad so I feel like I’m spending more timeStart this off by saying this is my first Warhammer game but have enjoyed other total war games, most recently Troy. There are some good qualities about the game but I have two major gripes that really need some work.1. The rifts opening up in your territory is infuriating and honestly pretty stupid. The “corruption” they cause is just as bad so I feel like I’m spending more time babysitting the rift spawns than actually playing the game. I have to amass a bunch of tiny crap armies to ensure my land won’t get absolutely eaten by armies coming through the rift or corruption causing rebellion and I never want to play these fights because they do not pose a real threat and if you make any advancements in your territory you will be encountering a ton of these fights.2. This is honestly the worst one, I missed the first rift event on my play through not thinking it was that big of a deal, never missed one after, and this put me behind and I lost. I really have no idea how I could have came back, and I really didn’t think that just missing one event would be so catastrophic that it would ruin the entire run. I had no idea who had claimed the souls before me so it was impossible for me to attack that nation and to ensure they couldn’t win. It would have been great to know or have an option to prevent them from just outright winning but sadly that isn’t an option so I ended up wasting a good 12 hours worth of play time.Some other minor issues I had was the game crashes all the time. I also felt like my units were consisted of a bunch of morons that I had to constantly babysit so they didn’t just stand there and get murdered. It felt like the AI knew when my archers were in skirmish mode and would run at them until they turned around (they were behind a line of infantry mind you) and they would then stop and let their archers fire on me and I wouldn’t be firing back. Not the biggest issue most of the time but often I’d get stuck toying with my cavalry and had forgotten to take them off skirmish so my front line would get hit 2-3 times before I caught on. Also on some higher difficulties it feels as though, no matter the infantry, my units just lose in hand to hand combat. It felt undeserved in many cases as I’d have two superior units fighting one and they would just lose making it feel like an artificial challenge because the devs can’t create a smart enough AI to actually challenge the user!On the other hand the game is not all bad and I’m sure with a couple of balancing patches it will be better just kind of disappointing at release… Expand",3

The graphics however, its obvious this is a reskin of 3 kingdoms (a game I utterly hate), everything on campaign map looks grainy same issue with 3k.  I thought it was me but then I compared it to WH2 - its NOT even close to WH2 quality, this must be addressed.Campaign is unbalanced and AI spam is just tedious, battles there is nothing new at all, even managed to destroy a 20 stack slannesh army in 2minutes, really what is the point in having great graphics/unit textures if AI just rushes you.AI - Yes CA after 10 years of warscape it is still a brain dead on arrival Battle AI.  As for siege fix/improvement, well you just copy/pasted the terrible 3K siege maps straight in to WH3, please just go back to WH2 sieges and make slightly bigger settlements, modders can do it why can't you??Overall and I'm sure there are several other issues but I can't be bothered (yes that’s how the game makes me feel right now) its average, not a great launch, bit similar to Rome2 launch in my view.Not sure why this got such high critics review - they obviously spent their 15 mins review time smiling  at the cute Nurglings!

Unfortunately, the gaming industry made huge disappointöment. Especially developers like Creative Assembly, which I'm gonna talk about them and their games. CA betrayed their real total war players. A couple of years ago, they bought Warhammer rights and began to invest in that franchise. Since then, all their historical content falling into decline. They became part of remastering trend like any other developers instead of presenting an entirely new historical game. We 'real' total war players have expected to see Medieval III total war. But the CA insisted to denied that request and never changed the idea of not making this game. The company lost its 'creativity' and truthfulness. Thankfully we have some great dedicated modders. We are able to play historical games despite even the vanilla version being unplayable. (such as total war kingdoms 1212 mod, for attila total war) The latest two historical entries of total war were also horrendous. These games are only playable with mods. Before diving into games themselves, you have to check out  Steam workshop. It seems there will be no bright future for historical games. CA's failure to fulfill expectations is really frustrating.Furthermore, don't get me wrong. CA could develop and release Warhammer title I've no problem with that. But in my opinion, that Warhammer addiction of CA ruined real total war games. Not to mention many good other Warhammer games can be found on the market, like Warhammer 40k, which is far better than the CA invention 'total war version. In conclusion, not just CA itself, the whole gaming industry went into decline in the last decade. Maybe they read this feedback (highly doubt it) and reconsider their development and marketing strategy.PS: The good thing about Metacritic review is some edgy kids don't bother me with irrational replies.

It’s the perfect blend of staying loyal to its retro roots while implementing subtle modern improvements. It’s such an honest homage to the classic side scrolling Ninja Turtles beat ‘em ups from the NES and SNES era to which it really feels like this was actually the next Turtles game that should have released after Turtles In Time. The graphics are amazing. Very gorgeous highly polished sprites that stay true to the roots without any unnecessary forcing of modern flashy effects. Same goes with the music, for the most part it sounds like it is exceptionally crafted music from the SNES era. There’s even some licensed music that fits surprisingly well. Every part of the presentation  of this game is so well executed that someone could easily mistake this for a 25 year old game, and I mean that as a compliment. The maps are all extremely well designed, and many of them give nods to levels from old Turtles games. The gameplay is super tight, and does an awesome job of balancing the difficulty for all players. New players can easily pick it up and make it by with button mashing, and experienced players can appreciate the subtle level of complexity to the move sets. Initially I was disappointed in the length of the game - you can easily beat it in 2-3 hours, but the game is designed for you to replay the levels. Each level has challenges and secrets, and while they’re not the most exciting, it does give you more reason to keep playing. Also, there is an extremely seamless drop in and out system for online multiplayer, and it’s genuinely fun playing with random people. With all things considered, the $25 price tag is perfect for the content in this game. Especially considering that you are paying for such a genuine TMNT experience, even down to the carefully designed opening video that insanely so close to the cartoon. I don’t score games as 10 often. But for what this game set out to be, with what it is priced to be, and the amount of additional content added into the game, it truly excels at everything that it set out to do. This is how fan service games should be. With consideration of what it was trying to do, it’s a perfect game. Easily the best of all time in the beat ‘em ups genre.… Expand",10

Giving you the long-awaited ability to play as MasterTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is a call back to a bygone era of games. This is very much a sequel to TMNT: Turtles in Time, but it also is leaning very, very heavily on nostalgia, pretty much running every single popular character and toy from the original series in the game as a boss or someone you have to rescue. Giving you the long-awaited ability to play as Master Splinter, April O’Neill, and Casey Jones, this game has seven characters instead of four, and while it is a side-scrolling beat ’em up, there are some differences between the characters. Unfortunately, this game also shows why they don’t make these games anymore – this game took a lot of effort to make, and is nicely animated pixel art, but it’s only two and a half hours long. If you try and collect everything, it might take you another hour… but after that, it’s just grinding for some tedious achievements, which isn’t fun. The other problem is that beat ’em up gameplay remains very simplistic, and this game is no exception. The characters aren’t especially mobile, and while it reflects the design of the era, modern games are more fun to play and less awkward and stiff. This isn’t bad as far as beat ’em ups go – in fact, it’s a reasonably good example, though Turtles in Time felt like it had better variety – but the game is still very simple, and not really super fun to play. Being short is a saving grace as much as it is a drawback; if it was any longer, you’d get bored. Which is the biggest problem, really – it isn’t 1994 anymore. Back in the day, I remember enjoying these games, but today, they’re just too simple compared to modern game design. The game is quite easy even on the middle difficulty setting, but cranking the difficulty didn’t really make me any more enamored with it. The high difficulty older beat ’em ups were designed as quarter eaters; modern games don’t benefit from that, but it reveals just how little content there actually is. While it was kind of nostalgic seeing all these characters again, the voice acting wasn’t great and the only thing that made me laugh was the “twist” at the end. All in all, I can’t recommend this trip down memory lane unless you get it for free, like playing it on Game Pass or something. There, it is a reasonable thing, as you can taste it and see if you want to see it through, and even if you do, it won’t feel like it took a bite out of your wallet for such a short and mediocre experience.… Expand",5

That isn't to say this game is bad, it's okay, but seriously this is the kind of game that would have been released on the Xbox 360 Live Arcade for $15. Wait... oh, that actually kinda did happen. People were hyping this way too much. They kept saying ""oh there's so many challenges and collectibles and leveling up your character"" but none of those add up to anything. You get points going through the game which unlocks more health or moves but it doesn't add anything to the game really. Leveling up doesn't do much. The challenges are just things like don't get hit or don't fall in a pit. There are no secrets really and Casey Jones was already shown as an unlockable character so... online play is the only thing left after you beat this. You'll finish this game in a couple hours. The replayability is minimal. How do I write a review here, there's so little? You'll get into it, see the throwback stuff, see some jokes and cheesy lines, you'll be hooked to keep playing because level 1 feels so classic. You see the stuff from the cartoon, pokes at old jokes and classic 90s kids things. Then you'll start getting annoyed by the gameplay a few levels in. You aren't pumping in quarters but some of the enemies and bosses are crafted to cough up quarters. The music in some levels just doesn't match the game. Some of the music is great but like TMNT 2 it feels like a desperate cash-in that ignores what made it so good in the first place. It just feels off. The game is made for multiplayer but I didn't find any type of play to be all that fun. First time through I got all but 2 of the collectibles and most of the challenges. I started with Donny, balanced and simple but a weird style to play with less reach than expected. After finish I played through a level with each character and had no interest in playing again. Raphael is by far the worst to play with. Casey Jones plays like a wrestler and is too much of a ""one joke"" character. Leo, Mikey, Splinter, and April are the typical beat-em-up characters. The voice overs are... well. I'm not sure if it's just that these guys are all older or if they were recording these with cell phones on an airplane. They sound wrong and distorted. None of them quite sound like their core character. I felt it was a little lazy they didn't voice the cut scenes most of the time except for one line quips. Just text on a screen. The story is basically a childish mix of classic 90s cartoon tropes. The endings slightly change depending on who you play as, again just another nostalgia nod to the cartoon. The taunts are annoying. If you play online half the time everyone is just doing this. You hear them a lot. One taunt over and over. The specials aren't very unique to the character. The jokes and nostalgia are fun the first time around but the second time through these just seem like old pizza found under the couch. Once those wear off the game seems very empty. Now, I'm sad and I wish I bought a pizza instead.… Expand",4

También debo destacar los efectos de sonido, más que notables. En cuanto a modos de juego, está la historia y la aventura, echando en falta algún modo más. A este punto añado los coleccionables, que creo que se podrían haber diseñado mejor o dar algún incentivo para conseguirlos, que se incluyesen mejor en la progresión del personaje.

This was a core mechanic I haven’t seen before. The illustrations in the manual are beautifully retro and it fits thematically in the game[SPOILER FREE REVIEW] It's a nostalgic throwback to early Zelda games. However this game has collectible ""manual pages"" scattered all across the world that give you information on the mechanics of the game as well as how to solve certain puzzles. This was a core mechanic I haven’t seen before. The illustrations in the manual are beautifully retro and it fits thematically in the game (because old adventure games used to have these types of physical illustrated manuals) and the way the manual reveals the secrets of the game to you was at times very rewarding. The game has a medium sized, but very packed open world. Sadly the progress route through the game is actually very linear, but not necessarily very clear and traveling around the world is a bit slow. I got stuck in the middle of the game because there was one specific location I needed to go to get a certain item (something straight out of the Zelda games) to proceed, but it was hidden in a way that I walked past it 2 times and used several hours just going around in circles (I managed to solve some endgame puzzles while doing this though). Multiple entrances or a subtle hint telling me that this was the next location I was supposed to go to would’ve made this part of the game less annoying. There was also an area (Lower Miasma) that you can drop down to that has a locked door and if you don’t have the key, you’re stuck and you have to either kill your character or reload the game to get out of there. I consider this a design flaw. A shortcut elevator from the checkpoint would have sufficed. Maybe they’ll patch this later. Some of the puzzles were pretty hard, but I managed to solve them all without help by systematically going through the world and writing down notes or taking pictures with my phone when I encountered something suspicious. There are some mechanics in late game that help you find the unsolved puzzles/areas that are required for the true ending, but you need to do some exploration and write down notes to get the true ending. Puzzles themselves are pretty good - all of them (except the optional ones) are solvable if you pay attention to your surroundings as well as the game manual. The most obscure ones are optional and actually require you to put some time into figuring them out. I’m pretty sure very few people will solve them without guides, but I don’t mind just reading about them online (just reading about them blew my mind because solving them really requires effort and solving them reveals one final secret message that is definitely worth checking out). Bosses were quite easy for me (they usually took 3-5 tries which for me is pretty optimal), but I can see them being hard for someone who doesn’t take the time to find all the upgrade materials around the world. The way you beat the bosses is somewhat similar to Soulsborne games, so experience with their mechanics and slower combat will give you a slight advantage. They’re easier than Soulsborne bosses, but you still need to recognize openings between enemy attacks and mashing buttons will get you killed. One enemy encounter seemed to spike in difficulty, but after a couple of tries I bought some single use items and cheesed the fight. Game also shares Soulsborne’s minimalistic, ambiguous storytelling. To have any idea what the story was about, you need to go to the forums or watch a lore video. I prefer stories with character development and understandable goals and motivations. Games like Dark Souls or Inside at least gave me slightly more concrete themes I could latch on to. But then again, I didn’t expect there to be ANY story so I was happy that they at least tried to add some bits of lore for the community to figure out. The secret mechanics of this game were so fun that I wished it had more of them! Because of them I’d also recommend not to read about the game too much and just play it. Because of its unique mechanic of collecting the manual pages, this might be one of my favorite Zelda-like games ever. I did get stuck once which was really annoying because I felt I was just wasting time running around areas I had already been to. Using guides for this game is not recommendable so I wish they’d at least make the main path of the game more visible and add a few more shortcuts so that backtracking to some areas wasn’t so time consuming. I’d give the game 9/10 (strong recommendation) but because this is a disadvantageous time for smaller adventure games, I’ll give it one bonus point.… Expand",10

I'm a huge classic Zelda fan and loved the indie game Death's Door from  last year.  I'm about three hours in and incredibly disappointed.  The game looks great, but the feel is all wrong.  Your character moves like molasses and the combat is simply dreadful - your attacks knock enemies back, but you move incredibly slowly, meaning every encounter, you hit an enemy, then have to close distance to hit it again.  You have a stamina meter and dodge a la Dark Souls, but the meter depletes incredibly quickly and replenishes very slowly, so I find myself reluctant to use it for anything.  The first boss battle was a tedious slog because the boss moves way faster than you do, and if you try to use your roll (or run, which is initiated by rolling) to close distance, you'll run out of stamina, be unable to block, and take double damage. The world design is... all right?  There's something odd about the blocky art style though - it's very difficult to tell what connects to what.  Several times I've been trying to walk across something, only to hit the 'shift perspective' button and realize that what I thought connected to the platform I was standing on is actually twelve tiles away. There are lots of good ideas here but the game badly needed some playtesting to adjust the combat mechanics and flow.  Unfortunately, I'm finding it incredibly tedious and not fun at all.  If you're looking for a great Zelda-esque title that incorporates some elements of Dark Souls with a compelling story and fun combat, play Death's Door.… Expand",4

Why should I fight anything? Why should I solve any of these puzzles?It's a fundamental part of games design and without it the entire experience doesn't click at a basic level.It's perhaps to be expected that a single developer isn't going to make something that Nintendo could, but when it's just a small piece of games design that would only take the developer a few weeks to implement and that would make an incredible difference to the overall product quality, it just feels like such a huge, unfortunate missed opportunity.As things stand, if you've never played a good adventure/ARPG game, then Tunic is a serviceable, if underwhelming, introduction to the genre.

The interesting ideas, such as finding and building a manual to the game in the game by finding pages of it scattered around the map are all overshadowed by the really really bad game design of the main gameplay loop. From soulslike games, we have the combat relying on learning enemy behavior, timing and precise dodging, except the combat also consists of just one weapon with one three-strike combo and a handful of abilities of questionable balance and usefulness. In addition, you can literally just save at bonfires, and it respawns all enemies, which is an absolute pain, because: From early Zelda games, it takes linearity and backtracking, and goes absolutely overboard especially in the backtracking part - from the very first minute, I could see paths that I could not access, but it was clear I would get to them later after getting a sword and cutting the surrounding small vegetation down in a suitably Zelda-like fashion, and that would be fine, except these additional paths were largely just shortcuts or additional passages to the places I was already traversing, meaning that their use was to literally allow me to get back to the places where I already was, and this was proven true soon after. Of course, I had then to again participate in the same unsatisfactory combat against the, mostly simplistic and boring, enemies I already killed before, and after next puzzle, I had to go back and do it again to reach a next path, and so on and on. A lot of people seem to like the game, so most likely you, the one reading this word-vomit, will enjoy it too, but for me, I just can't see a reason why to play it over Zelda or Dark Souls games, because it wouldn't really stand on its own as either of those, much less a proper combination of them.… Expand",2

The game quickly gave way to impossible bosses and large explorable areas with SWARMS of enemies that will chase you to the ends of the earth and kill you if you don’t kill them first or get to a bonfire, uhhh…I mean save point. Look, Dark Souls absolutely has its fanbase and absolutely has a right to exist.  That being said, I **** hate DS game mechanics.  The mechanics of(1) Every enemy respawns when you use a bonfire(2) Leveling up and only being able to refill Estus at bonfires(3) Impossible, rage-inducing bosses(4) Swarms of enemies on a map that will hunt you brutally because **** you(5) Unable to progress in another way until you open the mandatory linear path. I don’t /like/ that gameplay loop, and quite frankly Tunic very lazily copy and pastes this formula into their own world without thought for how it affects the exploration or the player experience.  Why build such a beautiful game that in the first two hours is such a delightful, pleasant experience, only to rip that feeling away and say “lol, it’s just Dark Souls now”. Additionally, there are /mandatory/ linear path progression points that are hidden in ways that THE PLAYER CANNOT SEE THEM.  Due to the limitations of the top-down isometric viewpoint, you cannot rotate the camera in 3D (a la Fez).  So…the dev’s used this as an excuse (challenge?) to just hide ESSENTIAL ladders and ropes behind walls and scenery that you have to blindly guess as to where they are?  **** actually off.  That’s not fun, nor challenging, it’s just **** Long story short, I loved the art and early feel of this game, but then the game decided to ruin itself with poor accessibility settings, bad level design, and Dark Souls mechanics.

Want to avoid feeling miserable as you're forced into playlists you don't like purely because if you don't get the rewards, you'll be left behind? Tough. Suffer. And no, the campaign in Witch Queen is not good. Have the people positively reviewing this one actually played any good games in their lifetimes? It's pretty, but literally all that happens is ""Hive get ghosts"" and you already knew that going into it. Everything else in the campaign is just one big lore dump, cool for hardcore enthusiasts, but for people just looking to have a good time, it is mind-numbingly boring. Legendary difficulty is a joke with how insane the power creep has gotten, and the only form of challenge Bungie can muster together is artificially inflating enemy health and damage. The negatives don't even end there. With old content being regularly deleted with no signs of ever returning and seasonal stories taking the forefront, anyone just now getting into the game or returning after a hiatus will NEVER be able to experience the story they missed firsthand. Much the opposite, you're just thrown into current events and the game pretends like you've been there all along, only providing a brief synopsis of what happened in a little circle in the corner of your map. This is, perhaps, some of the worst methods of storytelling I've ever experienced, and the cost of staying up to date is substantial - Bungie even SELLS you DELETED CONTENT just to access whatever leftover scraps that remain in the game. Please, avoid this game like the plague.

It might have had introduced many new features to the game, it also took a lot away.The base game had issues but now I am only here to talk about the issues of the expansion.Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak introduced about 17 new monsters from about 6 of them are just variants. 7 of them are returning monsters and the 4 are new. It is about 10 monsters less than what was in Iceborne. Two new locales from which only one is in some way good and the other one is just very lacking.One thing I did not really like about Rise or it's expansions in the very beginning was the way how urgent quests are introduced to you. In MH4U, you will be given one quest which introduces a new monster to fight. This way you won't have to complete these key quests in order to unlock an urgent quest and repeat defeating the same monsters over and over. This is really present in the expansion, where the new content is unlocked only at the very latest parts of the expansion.It was really dull to repeat such things, especially when the game had removed all the additional things that could have made the thing more difficult. No more did you even have to find the monster, the monster is already found for you or no longer you had to prepare for going into the cold with hot drinks. It is just the thing that you go there, defeat the monster and then it's done.Anyway the game was fun despite many issues, until the biggest issue was introduced. The biggest issue in my opinion is the fact of how the game is being updated. The game is unfinished and the content that was supposed to be there is missing at launch. They add features that were supposed to be there at launch. Though it is not as bad as what it was with the base game, where they added the final boss and ending later. It is still the reason why I stopped playing the game. The content that is missing is just variant monsters. The first update was just the worst. They keep recycling content from the previous game and no one really cares except I. I will not see a long run for the title if they won't be adding anything that is really new. They are using the fact that some players were not able to own MHW and experience it's content as an excuse for recycling same assets over and over. The game feels hollow because of this and if it goes on like this the game's roster of monsters will just be the strangest. Most of the monsters from the game will just be variants. It just feel weird and not fun at all. It is so lazy. This game had the potential to introduce more Frontier monsters or something big but instead we just get recycled content from a technologically more advanced title.… Expand",3

It doesn't really feel like his stories can exist on other platforms and come off as well made as they are. That doesn't mean everything is a hit. There's a few points in this game that come off as flimsy, almost like they came up with a really neat idea but couldn't figure a good way to tie it in with the proceeding plot points. And not every character works in the grand scheme of things. Some are just very annoying to have on screen and don't serve a large purpose to the overall story. The puzzles can be fun and unique too but the way they are designed can be rough. If you've realized you won't make it to the end before the time runs out, the back up checkpoint system they added here won't really save you. It can be tedious to finally figure out the puzzle at the end and not have the time needed to complete it so you have to restart it all over. But, at the end of the day, it's all worth it here. I would make a recommendation that, if you plan on playing this primarily on the Switch in docked mode to only play in handheld mode. The docked mode for this game is one of the worst I've seen on Switch. There's alot of tearing on the character models throughout the whole thing. The FPS can drop to single digits at times.

The former fell pretty flat for me compared to the latter.My main problem is that Mizuki didn't really have much of a character arc.Gimmicks aside you could swap her with anyone and the game would still work,  nothing changes story wise.It's amazing how much of a step back she is to her first game appearance.Her chemistry with Aiba is kinda ok, but there's not really any deep bonding going on like Ryuki and Tama, who shoulda have gone back to being the leads in the last act since they had more to overcome.The pacing was worse than the first game.It would really help to make the game shorter and the plot tighter without all the bloat like the constant pointless detours or especialy the parts where the characters just keep repeating the same plot points over and over.Localization cut some stuff whitout motive, i can guarantee that the in game voice of a certain tool misses pieces of info (which I won't mention for spoilers).I liked the first AI game and this one felt lackluster compared to that.Still, it is worth checking out if you enjoyed the 1st game, at 20 euro no more than that.it's not the disappointment that ZTD was but it's closer than I expected.… Expand",6

What the plot did with what couldwas so desperately trying to force myself to like this game. The charm however is just not there with the characters this time around The plot also dragged on and wasn't terribly interesting. The only thing keeping my going was a lot of really fun factoids with philosophy and science were explored and implemented in the plot in ways I didn't expect. What the plot did with what could have been a cool premise though just failed to be exciting and felt like it was overly fluffed out with so much uninteresting garbage that i was constantly combating with myself on not wanting to go any farther but being committed because I was such a fan. The characters, although familiar because most are returning from the prior game. They just all arnt as likable anymore. It's clear that the writers expected you to play the first game because you're sorta given the developed characters from the first game and they just stay that way. The returning characters sorta lost their charm because not a lot of exploration into who they are happened as deeply as before. The newer characters explored just wernt very interesting either and I found them all so unlikable. For a plot focused game this was disappointing. I was such a fan of the first game that I seriously recommend it to everyone. I think however the game just have been a stand alone and there really was no need at all for this sequal. This just felt like it was trying to do plot twists as good as before and constantly trying to one up itself but honestly nothing came across as shocking. Some of the mysteries constantly were so vague that I just found it so boring when some of the less interesting stuff was explored. What infuriated me the most about this game was the over-use of the 'their phone is off' plot device. Like.... Everyone had a phone that's off somehow and this is used as a plot device constantly to get your character to visit every single area to scope out that character that isnt anywhere and only gets revealed once you visit everywhere. This is so incredibly annoying when it's done over and over and over and over and over again. It felt so forced and uncreative. I would have loved a more natural feeling of movement from place to place. The reused assets were also annoying. So much was reused from the previous game that I was exhausted seeing some of these places again that I've already seen so much of from the first game. Combine that with the previous complaint of visiting areas over and over, ugh, this was bad. This sequal really didn't need to happen.… Expand",5

2903,"It’s been at least a decade since I played a Kirby game. The last time I played, it was Kirby’s Epic Yarn on Wii -console. I love a good platformer and Kirby and the Forgotten Land promises to give that to me. Does this seventeenth installment of the series does any good? STORY, GAMEPLAY, CONTROLS, GRAPHICS, DIFFICULTY AND SOUND
The story of the game is rather simple and easy;It’s been at least a decade since I played a Kirby game. The last time I played, it was Kirby’s Epic Yarn on Wii -console. I love a good platformer and Kirby and the Forgotten Land promises to give that to me. Does this seventeenth installment of the series does any good? STORY, GAMEPLAY, CONTROLS, GRAPHICS, DIFFICULTY AND SOUNDThe story of the game is rather simple and easy; something horrible happens and Kirby got sucked into another reality. It is a post-apocalyptic world called the New World. His friends Waddle Dees are being kidnapped and a creature from the New World called, Elfilin, comes to help him. So, that’s the story of the game. The story is good, but I didn’t like how absent the storytelling was. It basically was told in the beginning and in the end-part of the game. The gameplay and controls were good and simple. The game is played by levels that are opened one by one. On every level Kirby must not just fight with the enemies, but also collect coins, collectables and hidden Waddle Dees. Waddle Dees are important because they open the final boss of every area. Player must collect certain amount of Waddle Dees, which was rather easy to do. I didn’t found myself in a situation where I must go back and collect more of them. Every level is well-designed and easy to maneuver in. Kirby can have about ten different weapons (one at time) and all those were good choices from the developers. Kirby can also use Mouthful Mode, which is a mode where he can transform into bigger object that also have moves he can use. Kirby and the Forgotten Land has a hub, called The Waddle Dee Town, area that can be grown and changed by the amount of Waddle Dees plyer collects. Throughout the gameplay I could open a fishing area, Kirby’s own home and shops where I could by items that I can use in the levels. Kirby could hold on to one item at once. I used the extra health, which came useful in the more demanding boss battles. All weapons are also upgradeable. Along the gameplay, player finds blueprints, that can be used to upgrade the weapons. This also helps alot in demanding boss battles. Before player can upgrade the weapons, they must do some extra stuff; player must finish time-limit levels that gives Rare stones that are used to upgrade. Kirby and the Forgottel Land is also co-op, yes it can be played with another player. I didn’t try this since I played this alone. Graphically Kirby and the Forgotten Land looks nice. It has smooth grpahics and beautiful colours. All the character models are well-designed and the level-design is amazing, as well. Every area was different than the previous and they all had certain style they followed. What comes to the difficulty level, I found the game to be rather easy, but some boss battles were crazy and I wouldn’t beaten them without an extra item and upgraded weapons. The sound in the game was amazing. All the soundtracks were quintessential Kirby what we are used to from the 90’s games. There is a band in the hub area, that plays all the music of the game. It was a nice add. FINAL THOUGHTSKirby and the Forgotten Land is very good new Kirby game. It leans towards the easy-side, but the level design and the variety of the levels and the areas made it nice to play. All the extra things player can do and collect made the game very much worth the price.… Expand",9

The 3D level design works very well, although sometimes it feels a little cramped as many of the levels don’t have much vertical depth, so they end up feeling a bit linear at times. But the visual presentation of the games is excellent, they really take you through a variety of settings. The mouthful mode is pretty gimmicky, but I actually very much enjoyed it, as it shakes up the routine formula of the game and adds good variety to the gameplay through some clever ideas. The game is still very short, you can easily complete the main part of the game in a weekend, but luckily they added a few elements to make you want to revisit the levels. Thanks to the Waddle-Dee village, I think they really stepped up their efforts in adding to the replay value of the game, which has always been a huge problem for Kirby games. It’s actually a bit more challenging than most other Kirby games, but if you are familiar with the franchise, that isn’t saying much. It’s still fairly easy to breeze through the game. Luckily there is some reason to come back and replay the levels, it has some fun objectives, and doesn’t feel like a collectathon that drags on for no reason. The game is super charming. Everything from the animations, the characters, the music, etc. There are a few segments where it feels a bit like a Pixar movie, which is very cool. If you have a Switch OLED, this is absolutely worth playing in handheld mode, as it is probably the most vibrant and colorful game I’ve played on the OLED so far. I like that Nintendo is starting to push the boundaries of the existing formulas of their catalog of games. The 3D design of this game was a very positive change for Kirby, and they landed it perfectly. I don’t think I have enjoyed a Kirby game like I did this one for a very long time.

Kirby visits a bunch of mysterious abandoned locations and has to rescue the waddle dees. The levels in this game are very unique with places like a mall, a tropical beach and an amusement park, and they are all fun to play. There are only 12 copy abilities which is kinda low but with the new feature that lets you evolve them, that completely makes up for it! They introduced mouthful mode which lets Kirby turn into so many bizarre items such as a car, a lightbulb or a staircase. This feature worked so well! The game looks visually stunning and is for sure the best looking Kirby game to date! However the one gripe I have with the graphics is the low frame rate especially for enemies at a distance, but that’s more the switch’s fault than the game’s. The soundtrack is amazing too which tunes that will likely become nostalgic in the future. The boss fights are some of the best Kirby fights there are, with really fun attack patterns. There are so many collectables and fun side games to go after that make this game that much more replayable! I do kinda wish there was maybe one more world of levels, but the ones we got are so good! This is definitely one of the best Nintendo Switch games yet, and if Nintendo put this much effort into more of their games nowadays,  I’d probably like the switch a lot more! Maybe we will get a full open world Kirby game someday since the franchise worked so well in 3D!… Expand",9

The frames aren't that bad and get smooth once you get closer and the difficulty doesn't really effect the game just could have made it better if it was harder. I think these are the only main gripes with this game. Starting with the combat it's really fluid and fun to use. Also kirby's dodge roll is really fun to pull off. This game has a small amount of copy abilities compared to the newer games, but with the upgrading system the abilities feel different enough to keep things fresh.  Next is the new ability kirby has called Mouthful Mode. This mode is very unique using obscure objects and performing attacks and other sorts of things with them.  I wish the game could have been harder and made me use these abilities against tough enemies. Mouthful Mode sometimes can be used as cool setpeices like flying through the sky, doing a mario kart style race, or becoming part of a rollar coaster. These ideas are so wacky and unique i with most of them weren't just throw away objects that you only use once or twice and end up using the same 5-6 Mouthful modes almost the whole game.The level design is great and there is so many little charming secrets to find throughout these levels adding re playability if you missed a secret. The setting of this game is something i didn't know i wanted from a kirby game. I'm tired of seeing kirby in this childish cartoony world. This game puts kirby in a post apocalyptic world and things get really eerie towards the end. Since this is a nintendo game the ost was already going to be spectacular and it is great.

The cutscenes were really detailed and fun to watch as well as the fun and easy to learn gameplay. Being able to craft and upgrade abilities by finding blueprints in the levels made for a satisfying sense of progression and replay-ability. The treasure road levels are short but trying to reach the goal time is really enjoyable and challenging. Speaking of challenging the game was pretty easy even in it's hard mode, but it didn't really affect my play through of the game too much, but I can certainly see how some people that enjoy a challenge may be disappointed by it's lack of challenge. The ending of the game is really epic and exciting and felt like a perfect way to finish the game. I haven't really played much of the post game but from what I have seen it looks awesome and introduces some new collectables. The figurines are really fun to collect and display and the fact that you unlock new sets throughout the game increases the games length a nice amount. Trying to save all of the waddle dees makes this games levels really replay-able and forces you too look throughout the whole level and discover fun secrets in the process. All of the abilities feel unique and fun to use, it's really enjoyable to find a different ability and switch between them in levels.

He meets a chinchilla-like character named Elfilin, and they need to explore the world. I won't rank the story because that would spoil. Play it for yourself.The most obvious thing about it is that it's a linear platformer. A lot of people don't like this. I don't really have an opinion on this. Frequently I compare this game to Odyssey. I personally like Odyssey's gameplay more, but this is fine. It doesn't bring down the experience. The levels are layered with secrets, specifically Waddle Dees that are needed to fight the world boss. I like this. I love exploration in platformers. There are only 12 copy abilities, but they're all fleshed out and tons of fun to use. There are even evolutions! There are a couple of copy abilities you can't take everywhere. They're called the Mouthful Mode. This is where Kirby inhales something like a car or traffic cone. Kirby looks a bit silly when he eats them, but they're all fleshed out like copy abilities and never overstay their welcome. The gameplay is 9.8/10. The only things bringing it down are nitpicks.How are the graphics? For starters, the detail is amazing. You can see every blade of grass, every bit of skin on Kirby jiggle, and stuff of the like. It has graphics comparable to Luigi's Mansion 3. It really makes a lost world look lively. The locations are beautiful and creative, such as Alivel Mall. It eerily looks like a normal mall, but it looks lively and not-so-eerie. The music is great, too! There was no bad song, and there were some stellar ones, such as Sword of the Surviving Guardian. The presentation is an 11/10, and rivals Luigi's Mansion 3.The game will take you about 15 hours to beat, including post-game. I 100% it, and I got 30 hours on it. There are 300 Waddle Dees as I previously mentioned, and there is another collectible in the post game. There are also collectible figures that you can display in Kirby's home. The content is 9/10.

In this case, I think the developers added just enough new features from the previous instalment for the game to feel fresh(ish) and fun, so good job here.-Visuals- WOW! Just WOW!

Худшего дер**а в своей жизни ни разу на компьютер не ставил. То что данная игра это тотальная недоработка и кошмар, это еще слабо сказанно.Если разработчики так сильно хотят денег за эту игру, то единственное желание это дать их игре место на торрентах, дабы они не заработали ни копейки и наконец-то поняли, что быть заднеприводным уродом это не значит что все покупающие вашу игру такие же.Звук который заикается и глючит каждый раз когда на экране появляются хвалёные толпы крыс. А иногда звук глючит и просто так. Качество текстур оставляет желать лучшего. Отсутствие FSR (хотя бы версию 1.0 дали бы, но нет). Даже на высоком уровне графики текстуры превращаются в мыло.Стелс миссии. Ммм, просто блаженство. Ты можешь бежать через всю локацию с Гуго и никто тебя не убьёт, особенно если проигрывается анимация открывания дверей.Растягивание сюжета, сотнями разговоров и медленной ходьбы, надоедают уже через 15-20 минут.Вначале игры говорится о том что надо бежать, Гуго плохо и его надо лечить, но нет ""А пройдёмся ка мы по полю и пособираем перья, а?""Отвратительное построение сюжетной линии лишь усугубляет и без того шаткое положение игры, из-за отвратительной графики и отсутствия оптимизации. В заключении хочу сказать лишь одно.

Whilst its combat is still clunky, the visuals, world building and character design had all been much improved. So why have I scored it so low. Well the thing that made 'Innocence' more than the sum of its parts was that it knew its strengths and kept a keen focus on the central narrative. The central narrative of Requiem is easy enough to understand but riddled with so much Deus Ex Machina that it really starts to stray onto the side of ridiculousness that the first game only flirted with. Amecia, who I loved in the first game, is now essentially a moron, and something that will occur to you the player takes a lot longer for it to dawn on her. Whilst you could explain her reasons as love for her brother, that only goes so far to cover the actions of someone who has essentially become a self righteous murderer. So what starts out well ends with 2 very unlikeable characters, an overused clunky combat system, and ultimately an ending that makes much of what you've been doing for 2 games completely pointless. The game still has merits as the world is beautiful and it's not necessarily a bad game, just not a particularly good one.… Expand",6

The architecture of the middle age buildings are detailed and gorgeous. The level designs were exceptional! The soundtrack is sometimes haunting, other times emotional or festive and at all times fitting for the atmosphere. The voice acting is incredible! Charlotte McBurney deserves all the accolades for her role as Amicia. The way her voice shakes or quivers in moments of turmoil or desperation makes you feel her pain and trauma in your bones. The gameplay is excellent. It's still a stealth game at its heart given the relatively fragile nature of the protagonist but this time you have more options in your arsenal to fight back. Amicia is tougher than ever! The story is emotional. It's deeply moving. It's one of the few video games that made me shed tears. The bond between the siblings and their companions will keep you engaged or stay on your toes from start to finish. Performance-wise I've only faced two noticeable stutters (for a total of less than 2 seconds combined) and by the time you're reading this they might be gone entirely. The smaller AA budget of the studio is only noticeable in facial animations. There were no major bugs and whatever minor bugs that doea exist, I didn't experience them or did not affect my enjoyment of the game. I expected a great time when I started playing. What I did not expect was to be hit with emotions that will stay with me for years to come. A Plague Tale: Requiem is a masterpiece.

On Series S it never was 60 fps. There are little graphical improvements. Pre-rendered cutscenes took away the wow-effect. Some in-game cutscenes had framerate drops. Amicias facelift is disappointing. She now has a jaw as if she would be 10 years older than in the previous title, but she and Hugo feel the same as old as in the previous game.I saw the open/close door cutscene too many times. And it is extremely illogical that Amicia slams through every door and locks (often also if no threat was behind) as if nobody could be on the other side, even if there theoretically could everytime be a soldier on the other side. The door animations were surely placeholders that were left in the final version of the game. Amicia lifts woodblocks so that child can pass under, Amicia lays wood blocks down, crawls underneath it (logic?). Amicia opens the heavy hatch halfway and first jumps down and only then did Hugo come behind so that the hatch could already fall on him, but no, the heavy hatch magically stays half open so that he can still elegantly go down afterwards. Ludonarrative dissonance. When arrived to town, right after fighting and fleeing from bandits with fire everywhere, they did jokes as if nothing happened.Amicia said ""Ignifer.. I forgot about this"" ... after all what she went through in the previous game?Amicia said the rats were “faster, more intelligent”. Not at all. I find them more intelligent in the previous game where they piled up.After going through doors they talk normally as if guards do not exist, which could stand behind the next corner.She walks chilly with her mother by a covered man in rubble while people help him, the game wants that you walk by slowly and chilly.They got to a village where they get treated very well as guests, but they take a grass on flames (very kind). Camera movement was clunky sometimes, as if it would hang on the wall models. Fade to white loading screen blinded me. Chapter 5 was the worst. 5 seconds freeze, motion blur disappeared. I have to move stuff around and walk over there and I have no Idea what their Idea is. Then suddenly ""there is ahole, i am going in"", out of nowhere and by accident there is a hole to trespass.Confusing stationary balliste snapping on the hay ball, then no reactions when shooting on other things, felt broken.There were side zones where there was nothing to progress or with no collectible, felt just unfinished.On a runaway section, you will stuck and die because the design has a 180 degree curve which no player would expect. Start of chapter 6 felt right overengineered compared to Chapter 5.There is a runaway section where has a dead end, but still there are resources and a collectible. Why to attract players to there, this does so not match with the current situation. When a soldier came for help, and they seem to know eachother, Me: Who the hell is this.Only by his dead I saw his name and saw ah the bad guy which name I also knew accidentally from a pause menu, where I already asked, why has this generic enemy even a name. Big massive soldier magically goes through a “loading screen” gap which was half as thin as himself. When pressing forward before a cutscene ends, animation quickly jumps from run to walk.She jumps right onto vases where she would have to pay extra attention to what she would land because she's not allowed to make any noise. How dumb, Amicia does everyting to pretect Hugo, but she let him go on a wall cliff without hesitate and without holding hands or anything else.One level is too stretched out, too big, doing roleplay and walk through gets old very quickly and you get to run with ludonarrative dissonance.Again 5s freeze, on Chapter XI.What a bad composed riddle with that big door without making logical commands. Again, forced to do what the developer wants. Characters, please simply talk to each other and think. Like on Uncharted. Then they make a “Look at” L3 Button but it is so clear now after all this, what is going to be focused.They go deeper and deeper even if they know there could be no return, this is so contradictory in protecting Hugo. But after all the bad things, the ending! Man the ending was one of the most epic things in gaming history. Really worth of a Plague Tale ending. This let me forgive very much of the inconsistent quality and some rushed things, the ending is something no one should miss. I hope, if a next title would come out, more consistent quality and less chapters would be the best for the game and for the developers.… Expand",7

It was taking me out of the experience quite a bit. Tweaking the settings did help a lot for me. Turning off motion blur was good, and this game puzzlingly has something called ""chromatic aberration"" turned on. When turning this off it also makes the game appear far less muddy. These two settings turned off helped the visuals quite a lot for me. To the point that I was able to look past the 30fps in no time. Overall the characters in this game are far more likable and believable for the most part.

The game is just a collection of worst modern gaming cliches, like characters constantly slowly squeezing through tight spaces (ssd instant loading, anyone?), pushing carts to get to a higher ground, hiding in tall grass etc. As for the actual gameplay, the puzzles are all incredibly simple and boring. Then there's the rigid, unengaging, frustrating stealth segments which are mostly trial and error that are actually actively punish player's creativity. The AI is very poor, with enemy behavior and patrol routes being totally arbitrary, and the actual amount of enemies in every segment is simply ridiculous, they basically walk holding hands and stepping on each other's toes. You simply cannot sneak around without killing them because of how poorly these levels are designed and yet your annoying companions constantly berate you for agressive play, testing your patience! The fact that Amicia moves annoyingly slow while crouching and does everything very slowly in general doesn't help, either. The infamous rats AI is glitchy as well, with them acting totally random. For example, I couldn't figure out how to dependably use bait, as they are simply ignoring it most of the time. The story is pretty stupid as well with irritating characters that either whisper or being hysterical and throwing temper tantrums (Amicia is especially obnoxious, btw). There are weird plot holes where Amicia suddenly passes out and stuff simply happens while she's out. Overall, the game is just aggravating bag of trial and error, poorly designed and balanced mess with none of truly great new ideas and everything that it has have been done better before by much better games. Granted, the stealth genre is very tough to pull off, requiring clever level design allowing for flexibility and careful AI programming, and this game have none of that. There's been a lot of back and forth about the 30fps cap because of supposed graphical upgrade, and all I can say that the game looks pretty (especially if you take brightness down a notch as it looks washed out by default at least on series x), but there's nothing I haven't seen before. It looks like typical modern game with heavy post processing effects like motion blur, depth of field and chromatic abberation. It's also very linear game, so it's pretty surprising for me that it doesn't run in 60fps. Guess all those rats don't come cheap, eh? Anyway, very overrated title and thoroughly dissapointing, clunky game which is a total slog to play.… Expand",4

I found the story line to be especially engaging. I will admit, I did feel more like a fly on the wall in an interactive film, but I didn't mind it. Sure, some of the traversal stuff can be a bit tedious but I found the general atmosphere and scenery to be very pleasing and soothing. The tension and stress levels were appropriate when encountering BTs. The biggest thing for me was the genuine emotional investment and attachment to the characters. Without going into spoilers, I've only ever shed a tear twice in my life for a game and both times were playing Death Stranding. Some of the plot lines are legitimately gut-wrenchingly emotionally charged, and I didn't expect that from this game. It's my first Kojima game as well; thoroughly impressed by the vivid and engaging story telling. The only negatives for me was one character in particular (I won't mention here to avoid spoilers) annoying the living hell out of me at every conceivable point to make extremely dull or unhelpful comments regarding the plotline or jobs. This may come down to the game difficulty (mine was set to easy - full disclosure), and in-game tips being set to maximum. Either way, you'll know who I'm talking about when you get going. In terms of mechanics, I love the whole traversal methodology. The challenge in finding the quickest/safest/most-efficient path to an objective was a fun experience. I also found use for many game mechanics I thought I wouldn't use (that's usually the case in games with a lot of features/mechanics). It's worth mentioning that the game has its fair share of bugs (i.e., truck handling was either way nerfed to be unusable at times, even at low speed and over mild terrain, or overlooked in terms of development/programming). Nothing deal-breaking - but it was frustrating at times. Overall, I found the mechanics to be fun. Finally, I found the asynchronous multiplayer system to be oddly satisfying. The fact that any input I have into the world has a direct impact on other player's experiences (for the better or for the worse) was really empowering. I actually felt compelled to complete highways despite the fact I would never use them; place ladders and climbing anchors even though I can get by fine without them. Everything felt like it was for a bigger purpose and I enjoyed every step. All-in-all, this is my personal favourite game of late. My 10/10 is from the heart - I truly enjoyed this game. Whether you will is completely different; I can appreciate that it's not for everyone. I definitely recommend giving it a go and putting the time in. Again, solid 10/10 from me. :)… Expand",10

It's a shame, this could have been one of the all-time great indies were it not for the combat. A few things out of the way first: the graphics, music, and aesthetic are fantastic. There's a very miniature/tilt-shift look to everything, and it's almost too cute. As the game progresses and you get deeper into the world, it does a great job of bringing you along with it. This game says very little to you, but still tells its story very well. It is clearly trying to drum up nostalgia for NES-era adventure games, and it nails it without being too on-the-nose. How it reveals things to you—both in story and in gameplay—is expertly done. This games puzzles aren't really puzzles in the traditional sense. It reveals things to you over time, but leaves it to you to realize that they have been revealed, and how to use what you've learned effectively. Its solutions are well hidden but not obtuse; I was able to complete the game with its ""true"" ending, and find many of its secrets without the use of any guides. The only cheating I did was to look up some things that would've required me writing down the solution myself, which would've been tedious but extremely on brand for the feeling the game was trying to evoke. Progression, puzzle-wise, this game is incredibly fair. What is less fair is the combat, which felt sluggish at best and infuriating at worst. While I feel most of what it required of the player was clear, actually accomplishing it meant grinding against enemies far too often, only winning due to what felt not like better execution but a better roll of the RNG. The difficulty didn't ramp linearly, but instead at steep cliffs requiring you to grind past them. A few times, it caused me to put the game down and I wasn't sure I was coming back. The combat is tedious in a different way from the puzzles: you need to sit through somewhat lengthy battles, and a few mistakes mean ""start over"". Any attempt to move through them faster will result in failure. None of this would necessarily be bad if it was fun, but there's nothing fun about it, again given the tedium plus feeling you won because of a lucky sequence of attacks. The combat would maybe even be fine, if they didn't unnecessarily stretch it out. There's a late-in-the-game ""rush"" you have to do against several waves of enemies, and it's incredibly unforgiving. This feels completely detached from the story, and feels like nothing more than an attempt to squeeze out some extra time out of the game. Up until that point I was willing to go along with it, but that made me just put the game into ""no fail"" mode to move forward. They could've skipped this and it would've made zero difference. Outside of combat, navigating the overworld was pretty unintuitive and takes way too long to become straightforward. Yet, you have to do it a lot. I wasted a significant amount of time just playing the ""how do I get back to that spot"" game, which isn't very fun nor interesting. Overall this game is really difficult to recommend to anyone: the extraordinarily punishing combat will alienate people looking for the excellent puzzle/exploration mechanics, yet the combat itself doesn't feel tidy, deep, nor interesting enough to make the more hardcore want to stick with it. The developers would've been better off scaling the combat back to let the great parts of the game really shine, but as it stands it's a game with too narrow of an audience.

I might not recommend Tunic to just anyone, but I would eagerly recommend it for a certain type of player.  That is to say, some folks get frustrated in a hurry if it's not made clear right away what the next step is.  Indeed, Tunic could and should be labelled downright cryptic.  In my case, though, I can savor a mystery.  And I don't mind a game that demands I stop to use my own deductive abilities to piece things together with only barely enough information to go on.  It lets me feel like I'm outwitting the game, while beneath the surface the game is quietly rooting for me to succeed.  Each obscure clue and baffling moment serves as an opportunity for a gratifying epiphany.  If you are like me and you vibe with that sort of thing, I think that Tunic will be an unforgettable experience for you.  It is a game that truly transcends the sum of its parts. The combat is difficult and similar to Dark Souls, which isn't my preference.  However, it could be argued that this aspect of the game is necessary for the game's ultimate payoff.  And there is always the No Damage mode to fall back on, if you need help getting past a particularly difficult part.  However, I would advise viewing the difficult combat as its own sort of puzzle.  Survival is often barely attainable, so you do need to exercise some thought and technique in order to persevere until the next checkpoint.  That said, if you simply hate the idea of combat there is still plenty of game for you here even without it, but it will be a fundamentally different experience if you choose to negate the combat entirely. Tonally speaking, the cute fox is a red herring.  The mood of this game is truly not so pleasant beneath the surface.  Again, this isn't my preference (I wish Tunic were more of the “enchantingly beautiful” sort of mysterious, versus the creepy and foreboding kind, which I would say it mostly is). It is best to go into this game completely blind.  I saw someone else compare it to Outer Wilds in that way, and I think they are right.  Don't look up videos.  Don't look up the game mechanics.  Don't look up anything.  Even reading these reviews is a big risk.  Like I honestly wish I could be more specific in this review, but it's better that I'm not, for the sake of the prospective players who are reading these.  Nothing is incidental and everything is a part of the mystery.  Even a small detail can wind up being a spoiler. If you are familiar with Zelda games, that will give you a good background for comprehending Tunic.  But don't make the mistake of thinking this is merely a fox-themed Zelda game.  Zelda may be the soil from which it sprung, but Tunic is its own weird and cryptic plant.… Expand",9

You can tell the developers are very fond of the source material. The older folk will enjoy this nostalgia trip and all the tiny details carried from those arcade games in the 90s. Younger audience can enjoy a very solid gameplay, avcompanied by  with fun voicelines tons of puns. This is a no brainer. You can't go wrong with this onr. You'll hours of fun out of those 10 bucks.Now, if you are still wondering what aspects of the game could annoy you. The game's too simple, you can pretty much finish the whole game just smashing the one attaco button, jumoing from time to time and pushing the ""special atttack"" a couple of tines per level. Don't get me wrong, you can pull somr sock combos and chain you attacks. However, it comes don't only to the d-pad and one attack button. You can juggle your enemies and throw them into other enemies, which is fun as heck, but the animations are so detailed that you sometimes try to act faster than the game allows and you'll take cheap hits from enemies cause you arr stuck in you cooldown frames. You can use the dodge button but you will, most likely, forget it even exists. Besides, again, you are on you cooldown frames so you are sruck until Leo stips swinging his swords around. Furthermore, there's no block button, you can't cancels your grabs of the enemies and you don't have ""ranged attacks"". All of this details were there back in the Manhattan project, so you can see where I'm going with this. The gameplay feels dated in a lot of places  Thet evolved the whole formula and got.set back by frecreating the old games too hard.All of this complains don't make the game less fun, just make it simpler and this game is too essy for the most part, except whennit comes to the challenges, which is all of this problems really stuck out while replaying the levels. Trying to complete the challenges encourages playing extremely passive and  running away from.your enemies. You can get vrry good at the game and even beat yout bosses with next to no damage and still not complete your challenges cause you got hit by a banana while you were trying to beat up a random easy foot soldier. I get that they're ""challenges"" and not everyone can beat them, but it sometimes feels more like luck than skill. You cannot restar a lvl either. If you fail a challenge you have to go back to the map and re enter the lvl, which is tedious. Good thibg is that you can complete each challenge on a different run, but it's still annoying!I don't wanna be too harsh on this game. I'm loving and me and my sister had a lot of fun completing the story mode. I loved it so much that I want it to improve for the sequel they will probably announce after how good it's selling.

Giving you the long-awaited ability to play as MasterTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Shredder’s Revenge is a call back to a bygone era of games. This is very much a sequel to TMNT: Turtles in Time, but it also is leaning very, very heavily on nostalgia, pretty much running every single popular character and toy from the original series in the game as a boss or someone you have to rescue. Giving you the long-awaited ability to play as Master Splinter, April O’Neill, and Casey Jones, this game has seven characters instead of four, and while it is a side-scrolling beat ’em up, there are some differences between the characters. Unfortunately, this game also shows why they don’t make these games anymore – this game took a lot of effort to make, and is nicely animated pixel art, but it’s only two and a half hours long. If you try and collect everything, it might take you another hour… but after that, it’s just grinding for some tedious achievements, which isn’t fun. The other problem is that beat ’em up gameplay remains very simplistic, and this game is no exception. The characters aren’t especially mobile, and while it reflects the design of the era, modern games are more fun to play and less awkward and stiff. This isn’t bad as far as beat ’em ups go – in fact, it’s a reasonably good example, though Turtles in Time felt like it had better variety – but the game is still very simple, and not really super fun to play. Being short is a saving grace as much as it is a drawback; if it was any longer, you’d get bored. Which is the biggest problem, really – it isn’t 1994 anymore. Back in the day, I remember enjoying these games, but today, they’re just too simple compared to modern game design. The game is quite easy even on the middle difficulty setting, but cranking the difficulty didn’t really make me any more enamored with it. The high difficulty older beat ’em ups were designed as quarter eaters; modern games don’t benefit from that, but it reveals just how little content there actually is. While it was kind of nostalgic seeing all these characters again, the voice acting wasn’t great and the only thing that made me laugh was the “twist” at the end. All in all, I can’t recommend this trip down memory lane unless you get it for free, like playing it on Game Pass or something. There, it is a reasonable thing, as you can taste it and see if you want to see it through, and even if you do, it won’t feel like it took a bite out of your wallet for such a short and mediocre experience.… Expand",5

It is safe to say it’s one of the best TMNT games, of course not that hard to achieve since it’s been quite a while. Some of the classics, like Turtles in Time or Hyperstone Heist, were also very good games, for their time, but they all had big issues when it comes to hit detection (I guess what we would call ""hitbox detection"" today), and this is mostly improved in Shredder’s Revenge, but it’s still not completely perfect, and we’re still going to get a few surprises here and there or unexpected hits coming from way off or position in the axis, and this is particularly evident in the hardest difficulty setting, where every hit we get hurts a lot. Continuing on the difficulty aspect, I think Normal is far so easy, whereas the next one available, which is called Gnarly, feels too punishing, and clearly the game was not properly balanced for this one, much.I feel the other great modern beat’em up game we got recently, Streets of Rage 4, manages difficulties quite a bit better, at least from Normal to Hard, and even going to Mania, you can feel the difficulty curve being smoother, so to speak, like there’s a much better ""difficulty progression"", if that makes any sense. That said, apart from that detail that could easily be tweaked and patched in the future, the game is pretty awesome and enjoyable. Performance wise, this game seems pretty easy to run and I encountered zero issues on my Ryzen 5 3600 and RTX 3060 Ti, which clearly is way more than enough PC a game like this needs, but I experienced zero frame drops or anything like that, it’s pretty much all the way. Moving on to the game’s Controls and how it feels in action, I think the improvement over the classic games is quite massive here: we have lots of different movements we can use, and none of them are particularly difficult to execute, they’re pretty simple and we have an interactive tutorial to learn all about these moves. The game offers six initial playable characters, and a seventh one unlocked after finishing the Story Mode, and that’s is a very nice amount of characters, compared to most beat’em up games, certainly, at least on release. The Graphics are nicely done and the UI is easily readable but, if anything, it would’ve been great to have some retro, CRT style, shaders available to use, as those would fit pretty well with the visual design in this game, even though the clean pixel design is quite well done as it is. The Music is absolutely amazing too, I can never get tired of it and just like in the old school games, the soundtrack is a crucial part of the experience when playing each level, and this game really delivers there, for sure. One final last flaw in the game though, the multiplayer has some cross-play related issues at the moment when it comes to Steam-Gamepass crossplay, in game it’s not currently possible to find online players other than those from the Epic Games version, no Steam or Gamepass players are shown currently, and it  seems to be a known issue due to certain versions needing an update.Furthermore, it does seem that in order to connect with Gamepass players, both Steam and Gamepass owners need to link their…Epic Games accounts, then invite using the Epic UI in game, a bit…weird, but again the developers have mentioned that it does seem that the Gamepass version needs an update. All in all, this is another must have beat’em up, especially if you liked the classic games, or more recently Streets of Rage 4, this one is quite good too; SoR 4 still feels like the more complete and bigger game, clearly with higher budget, but TMTN: Shredder’s Revenge is a pretty solid and affordable game in the genre, and quite enjoyable to play.… Expand",9

You could simply meditate and fill the super attack bar as many times as you wanted and finish levels without sweating!Attacking could be more complicated and unique rather than just simply pressing a key or two.As a conclusion, TMNT: Shredder's Revenge is extremely fun to play and worth playing, but I have to say that It has lots of unused potential and despite being short, it is repetitive.7.5/10(June - July 2022)… Expand",7

И я не шучу.Если посмотреть на последние тенденции игрового рынка, то можно заметить, что пиксельные проекты набирают все большую популярность. Не имею смелости говорить, что пиксельная графика должна остаться в прошлом. Это не так. Достаточно оглянуться на 360 и каждому это станет ясно.Но у всего хорошего всегда есть надоедливое ""НО"". И я снова о новых черепахах... У игры есть технические проблемы и пара проблем, связанны с геймплеем непосредственно. Недоработки? Думаю да! И без багов не обойдется. Но о них ниже.Первое: что встречает игрока, это, как не странно, меню игры, и его функционал относительно невелик. Я имею в виду функции системы сохранений. Бинд клавиш не всегда сохраняется, а слотов под сохранения режима истории попросту нет, и в своей специфики, игра доставляет этим неудобства.Второе: странное геймплейное решение - ""механика насмешек"". Это странно, потому что ломает сам ""beat ‘em up"" как включение в процесс. Выживание сводится к тому, чтобы в нужный момент успеть восполнить энергию супер удара одной кнопкой и следом его применить, снова и снова. Никакого временного отката способности нет. Вы можете просто бесконечно восполнять энергию, что позволит побить до 100% толп врагов на следующем участке, одной лишь супер атакой. Если вы играете в компании друзей, тогда о безопасности думать не нужно. Просто делайте это, пока друзья отвлекают противников на себя. Можно вообще не пользоваться стандартным набором атак. Не находите это странным?Третье: сетевые баги. Можно часто наблюдать, как в сетевой игре враги телепортируются с одного места на другое, или проигрывают анимацию, не соответствующую их действию. Иногда это генерирует серьёзные проблемы и приближает к проигрышу.Однако, пока бессмысленно ругать игру за ранние проблемы. Оценку я в любом случае занижу, но патча буду ждать с нетерпением.
